 `size`          | Returns the number of elements in a list or a map. When given a string it returns the number of characters. When given a path it returns the number of expansions (edges) in that path.

 `type`          | Returns the type of an edge as a character string.
 `keys`          | Returns a list keys of properties from an edge or a node. Each key is represented as a string of characters.
 `labels`        | Returns a list of labels from a node. Each label is represented as a character string.
 `nodes`         | Returns a list of nodes from a path.
 `relationships` | Returns a list of relationships (edges) from a path.
 `range`         | Constructs a list of value in given range.
 `tail`          | Returns all elements after the first of a given list.
 `uniformSample` | Returns elements of given list randomly oversampled or undersampled to desired size, e.g. `uniformSample([1, 2, 3], 5) -> [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]`
 `abs`           | Returns the absolute value of a number.
 `ceil`          | Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to given number.
 `floor`         | Returns the largest integer smaller than or equal to given number.
 `round`         | Returns the number, rounded to the nearest integer. Tie-breaking is done using the *commercial rounding*,  where -1.5 produces -2 and 1.5 produces 2.
 `exp`           | Calculates `e^n` where `e` is the base of the natural logarithm, and `n` is the given number.
 `log`           | Calculates the natural logarithm of a given number.
 `log10`         | Calculates the logarithm (base 10) of a given number.
 `sqrt`          | Calculates the square root of a given number.
 `acos`          | Calculates the arccosine of a given number.
 `asin`          | Calculates the arcsine of a given number.
 `atan`          | Calculates the arctangent of a given number.
 `atan2`         | Calculates the arctangent2 of a given number.
 `cos`           | Calculates the cosine of a given number.
 `sin`           | Calculates the sine of a given number.
 `tan`           | Calculates the tangent of a given number.
 `sign`          | Applies the signum function to a given number and returns the result. The signum of positive numbers is 1, of negative -1 and for 0 returns 0.
 `e`             | Returns the base of the natural logarithm.
 `pi`            | Returns the constant *pi*.
 `rand`          | Returns a random floating point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
 `startsWith`    | Check if the first argument starts with the second.
 `endsWith`      | Check if the first argument ends with the second.
 `contains`      | Check if the first argument has an element which is equal to the second argument.
 `left`          | Returns a string containing the specified number of leftmost characters of the original string.
 `lTrim`         | Returns the original string with leading whitespace removed.
 `replace`       | Returns a string in which all occurrences of a specified string in the original string have been replaced by another (specified) string.
 `reverse`       | Returns a string in which the order of all characters in the original string have been reversed.
 `right`         | Returns a string containing the specified number of rightmost characters of the original string.
 `rTrim`         | Returns the original string with trailing whitespace removed.
 `split`         | Returns a list of strings resulting from the splitting of the original string around matches of the given delimiter.
 `substring`     | Returns a substring of the original string, beginning with a 0-based index start and length.
 `toLower`       | Returns the original string in lowercase.
 `toString`      | Converts an integer, float or boolean value to a string.
 `toUpper`       | Returns the original string in uppercase.
 `trim`          | Returns the original string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
 `all`           | Check if all elements of a list satisfy a predicate. The syntax is: `all(variable IN list WHERE predicate)`.<br/> NOTE: Whenever possible, use Memgraph's lambda functions when matching instead.
 `single`        | Check if only one element of a list satisfies a predicate. The syntax is: `single(variable IN list WHERE predicate)`.
 `reduce`        | Accumulate list elements into a single result by applying an expression. The syntax is: `reduce(accumulator = initial_value, variable IN list \| expression)`.
 `extract`       | A list of values obtained by evaluating an expression for each element in list. The syntax is: `extract(variable IN list \| expression)`.
 `assert`        | Raises an exception reported to the client if the given argument is not `true`.
 `counter`       | Generates integers that are guaranteed to be unique within a single query for a given counter name. The syntax is `counter("counter_name", initial_value, [increment] = 1)`. The increment parameter can be any integer besides zero.
 `timestamp`     | Returns the difference, measured in milliseconds, between the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
 `id`            | Returns identifier for a given node or edge. The identifier is generated during the initialization of node or edge and will be persisted through the durability mechanism.
