1. [Deleting a node](#1-deleting-a-node)
2. [Deleting a node and its relationships](#2-deleting-a-node-and-its-relationships)
3. [Deleting a relationship](#3-deleting-a-relationship)
4. [Deleting everything](#4-deleting-everything)

## Data Set

The following examples are executed with this data set. You can create this data set 
locally by executing the queries at the end of the page: [Data Set](#data-set-queries).

## 1. Deleting a node

The `DELETE` clause can be used to delete a node.

```opencypher
MATCH (c:Country { name: 'United Kingdom' })
DELETE c;
```

Output:
```
Failed to remove node because of it's existing connections. Consider using DETACH DELETE.
```

This will however result in an error because `DELETE` can only be used on nodes that have no relationships.

## 2. Deleting a node and its relationships

The `DELETE` clause can be used to delete a node along with all of its relationships with the keyword `DETACH`.

```opencypher
MATCH (n:Country { name: 'United Kingdom' })
DETACH DELETE n;
```

Output:
```
Empty set (0.001 sec)
```

## 3. Deleting a relationship

The `DELETE` clause can be used to delete a relationship.

```opencypher
MATCH (n:Country { name: 'Germany' })-[r:LIVING_IN]-()
DELETE r;
```

Output:
```
Empty set (0.003 sec)
```

## 4. Deleting everything

To delete all nodes and relationships in a graph, use the following query.

```opencypher
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n;
```

Output:
```
Empty set (0.001 sec)
```

## Data set Queries

We encourage you to try out the examples by yourself.
You can get our data set locally by executing the following query block.

```openCypher
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;

CREATE (c1:Country { name: 'Germany', language: 'German', continent: 'Europe', population: 83000000 });
CREATE (c2:Country { name: 'France', language: 'French', continent: 'Europe', population: 67000000 });
CREATE (c3:Country { name: 'United Kingdom', language: 'English', continent: 'Europe', population: 66000000 });

MATCH (c1),(c2)
WHERE c1.name= 'Germany' AND c2.name = 'France'
CREATE (c2)<-[:WORKING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]-(p:Person { name: 'John' })-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]->(c1);

MATCH (c)
WHERE c.name= 'United Kingdom'
CREATE (c)<-[:WORKING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]-(p:Person { name: 'Harry' })-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2013 }]->(c);

MATCH (p1),(p2)
WHERE p1.name = 'John' AND p2.name = 'Harry'
CREATE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH { date_of_start: 2011 }]->(p2);

MATCH (p1),(p2)
WHERE p1.name = 'John' AND p2.name = 'Harry'
CREATE (p1)<-[:FRIENDS_WITH { date_of_start: 2012 }]-(:Person { name: 'Anna' })-[:FRIENDS_WITH { date_of_start: 2014 }]->(p2);

MATCH (p),(c1),(c2)
WHERE p.name = 'Anna' AND c1.name = 'United Kingdom' AND c2.name = 'Germany'
CREATE (c2)<-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]-(p)-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]->(c1);

MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n,r,m;
