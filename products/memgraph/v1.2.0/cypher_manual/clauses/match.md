## 1. Matching nodes

### 1.1 Get all nodes

Without specifying labels, the query will return all the nodes in a graph.

```openCypher
MATCH (n) 
RETURN n;
```

Output:
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| n                                                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "German", name: "Germany", population: 83000000})         |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "French", name: "France", population: 67000000})          |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "English", name: "United Kingdom", population: 66000000}) |
| (:Person {name: "John"})                                                                            |
| (:Person {name: "Harry"})                                                                           |
| (:Person {name: "Anna"})                                                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 1.2 Get all nodes with a label

By specifying the label of a node, all the nodes with that label are returned.

```openCypher
MATCH (c:Country)
RETURN c;
```

Output:
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| c                                                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "German", name: "Germany", population: 83000000})         |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "French", name: "France", population: 67000000})          |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "English", name: "United Kingdom", population: 66000000}) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 2. Matching relationships

### 2.1 Get all related nodes

By using the *related to* symbol `--`, nodes that have a relationship with the specified node can be returned.
The symbol represents an undirected relationship which means the direction of the relationship is not taken into account.

```openCypher
MATCH (:Person { name: 'John' })--(n)
RETURN n;
```

Output:
```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| n                                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Person {name: "Anna"})                                                                    |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "French", name: "France", population: 67000000})  |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "German", name: "Germany", population: 83000000}) |
| (:Person {name: "Harry"})                                                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 2.2 Get related nodes with a label

To only return *related to* nodes with a specific label you need to add it using the label syntax.

```openCypher
MATCH (:Person { name: 'John' })--(p:Person)
RETURN p;
```

Output:
```
+---------------------------+
| p                         |
+---------------------------+
| (:Person {name: "Harry"}) |
| (:Person {name: "Anna"})  |
+---------------------------+
```

### 2.3 Get related nodes with a directed relationship

The *related to* symbol `--` can be extended by using:
 * `-->` to specify outgoing relationships,
 * `<--` to specify ingoing relationships.

```openCypher
MATCH (:Country { name: 'France' })<--(p:Person)
RETURN p;
```

Output:
```
+--------------------------+
| p                        |
+--------------------------+
| (:Person {name: "John"}) |
+--------------------------+
```

### 2.4 Get a relationship

If you want to return the relationship between two nodes or a property of the relationship, a variable is required.
A directed or undirected relationship can be used.

This query returns the relationship and its type:

```openCypher
MATCH (:Person { name: 'John' })-[r]->()
RETURN type(r);
```

Output:
```
+--------------+
| type(r)      |
+--------------+
| WORKING_IN   |
| LIVING_IN    |
| FRIENDS_WITH |
+--------------+
```

This query also returns the property `date_of_start` of the relationship:

```openCypher
MATCH (:Person { name: 'John' })-[r]->()
RETURN type(r), r.date_of_start;
```

Output:
```
+-----------------+-----------------+
| type(r)         | r.date_of_start |
+-----------------+-----------------+
| WORKING_IN      | 2014            |
| LIVING_IN       | 2014            |
| FRIENDS_WITH    | 2011            |
+-----------------+-----------------+
```

### 2.5 Matching on a relationship with a type

To return a relationship with a specified type you need to use the type syntax.
A directed or undirected relationship can be used.

```openCypher
MATCH (p:Person { name: 'John' })-[:LIVING_IN]-(c)
RETURN c.name;
```

Output:
```
+---------+
| c.name  |
+---------+
| Germany |
+---------+
```

### 2.6 Matching on relationships with multiple types

To return relationships with any of the specified types, the types need to be chained together with the pipe symbol `|`.

```openCypher
MATCH (p:Person { name: 'John' })-[:LIVING_IN|:WORKING_IN]-(c)
RETURN c.name;
```

Output:
```
+---------+
| c.name  |
+---------+
| France  |
| Germany |
+---------+
```

### 2.7 Uncommon characters in relationship types 

If a type has non-letter characters, like spaces, for example, the backtick symbol \` needs to be used to quote these.
If the relationship type `LIVING_IN` had a space instead of an underscore, a possible query would look like this.

```openCypher
MATCH (:Country { name: 'France' })<-[r:`LIVING IN`]-()
RETURN r.name;
```

### 2.8 Match with multiple relationships

Multiple relationship statements can be specified in the query.

```openCypher
MATCH (:Country { name: 'France' })<-[l:WORKING_IN]-(p)-[w:LIVING_IN]->(:Country { name: 'Germany' })
RETURN p.name;
```

Output:
```
+--------+
| p.name |
+--------+
| John   |
+--------+
```

## 3. Matching with variable length relationships

### 3.1 Variable length relationships

If a node needs to be specified by its distance in relationship→node hops, the following syntax is used: `-[:TYPE*minHops..maxHops]→`.
minHops and maxHops are optional and default to 1 and infinity respectively. The dots can be omitted if both are not specified or if 
only one is set which implies a fixed length pattern.

```openCypher
MATCH ({ name: 'United Kingdom' })-[:LIVING_IN*1..2]-(n)
RETURN n;
```

Output:
```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| n                                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Person {name: "Harry"})                                                                   |
| (:Person {name: "Anna"})                                                                    |
| (:Country {continent: "Europe", language: "German", name: "Germany", population: 83000000}) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 3.2 Variable length relationships with multiple relationship types

If variable lengths are used with multiple stacked up relationship types, `*minHops..maxHops` applies to any combination of relationships.

```openCypher
MATCH ({ name: 'United Kingdom' })<-[:WORKING_IN|FRIENDS_WITH*1..2]-(P:Person)
RETURN P;
```

Output:
```
+---------------------------+
| P                         |
+---------------------------+
| (:Person {name: "John"})  |
| (:Person {name: "Harry"}) |
| (:Person {name: "Anna"})  |
+---------------------------+
```

### 3.3 Returning multiple relationships with variable length

If a variable length is used, the list of relationships can be returned by adding `variable=` at the beginning of the `MATCH` clause.

```openCypher
MATCH p=({ name: 'John' })<-[:FRIENDS_WITH*1..2]-()
RETURN relationships(p);
```

Output:
```
+----------------------------------------+
| relationships(p)                       |
+----------------------------------------+
| [[FRIENDS_WITH {date_of_start: 2012}]] |
+----------------------------------------+
```

## Data set Queries

We encourage you to try out the examples by yourself.
You can get our data set locally by executing the following query block.

```openCypher
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;

CREATE (c1:Country { name: 'Germany', language: 'German', continent: 'Europe', population: 83000000 });
CREATE (c2:Country { name: 'France', language: 'French', continent: 'Europe', population: 67000000 });
CREATE (c3:Country { name: 'United Kingdom', language: 'English', continent: 'Europe', population: 66000000 });

MATCH (c1),(c2)
WHERE c1.name= 'Germany' AND c2.name = 'France'
CREATE (c2)<-[:WORKING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]-(p:Person { name: 'John' })-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]->(c1);

MATCH (c)
WHERE c.name= 'United Kingdom'
CREATE (c)<-[:WORKING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]-(p:Person { name: 'Harry' })-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2013 }]->(c);

MATCH (p1),(p2)
WHERE p1.name = 'John' AND p2.name = 'Harry'
CREATE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH { date_of_start: 2011 }]->(p2);

MATCH (p1),(p2)
WHERE p1.name = 'John' AND p2.name = 'Harry'
CREATE (p1)<-[:FRIENDS_WITH { date_of_start: 2012 }]-(:Person { name: 'Anna' })-[:FRIENDS_WITH { date_of_start: 2014 }]->(p2);

MATCH (p),(c1),(c2)
WHERE p.name = 'Anna' AND c1.name = 'United Kingdom' AND c2.name = 'Germany'
CREATE (c2)<-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]-(p)-[:LIVING_IN { date_of_start: 2014 }]->(c1);

MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n,r,m;
```
