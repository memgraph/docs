## Security [Enterprise]

Before reading this article we highly recommend going through a how-to guide
on [managing user privileges](../database_functionalities/manage-user-privileges.md)
which contains more thorough explanations of the concepts behind `openCypher`
commands listed in this article.

### Users

Creating a user can be done by executing the following command:

```openCypher
  CREATE USER user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password'];
```
If the user should authenticate themself on each session, i.e. provide their
password on each session, the part within the brackets is mandatory. Otherwise,
the password is set to `null` and the user will be allowed to log-in using
any password provided that they provide the correct username.

You can also set or alter a user's password anytime by issuing the following
command:

```openCypher
  SET PASSWORD FOR user_name TO 'new_password';
```

Removing a user's password, i.e. allowing the user to log-in using any
password can be done by setting it to `null` as follows:

```openCypher
  SET PASSWORD FOR user_name TO null;
```

### User Roles

Each user can be assigned at most one user role. One can think of user roles
as abstractions which capture the privilege levels of a set of users. For
example, suppose that `Dominik` and `Marko` belong to upper management of
a certain company. It makes sense to grant them a set of privileges that other
users are not entitled to so, instead of granting those privileges to each
of them, we can create a role with those privileges called `manager`
which we assign to `Dominik` and `Marko`.

In other words, Each privilege that is granted to a user role is automatically
granted to a user (unless it has been explicitly denied to that user).
Similarly, each privilege that is denied to a user role is automatically denied
to a user (even if it has been explicitly granted to that user).

Creating a user role can be done by executing the following command:

```openCypher
  CREATE ROLE role_name;
```

Assigning a user role to a certain user can be done by the following command:

```openCypher
  SET ROLE FOR user_name TO role_name;
```

Removing the role from the user can be done by:

```openCypher
  CLEAR ROLE FOR user_name;
```

Finally, showing all users that have a certain role can be done as:

```openCypher
  SHOW USERS FOR role_name;
```

Similarly, querying which role a certain user has can be done as:

```openCypher
  SHOW ROLE FOR user_name;
```

### Privileges

At the moment, privileges are confined to users' abilities to perform certain
`OpenCypher` queries. Namely users can be given permission to execute a subset
of the following commands: `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `MATCH`, `MERGE`, `SET`,
`REMOVE`, `INDEX`, `AUTH`, `STREAM`.

Granting a certain set of privileges to a specific user or user role can be
done by issuing the following command:

```openCypher
  GRANT privilege_list TO user_or_role;
```

For example, granting `AUTH` and `STREAM` privileges to users with the role
`moderator` would be written as:

```openCypher
  GRANT AUTH, STREAM TO moderator:
```

Similarly, denying privileges is done using the `DENY` keyword instead of
`GRANT`.

Both denied and granted privileges can be revoked, meaning that their status is
not defined for that user or role. Revoking is done using the `REVOKE` keyword.
The users should note that, although semantically unintuitive, the level of a
certain privilege can be raised by using `REVOKE`. For instance, suppose a user
has been denied a `STREAM` privilege, but the role it belongs to is granted
that privilege. Currently, the user is unable to use data streaming features,
but, after revoking the user's `STREAM` privilege, they will be able to do so.

Finally, if you wish to grant, deny or revoke all privileges and find it tedious
to explicitly list them, you can use the `ALL PRIVILEGES` construct instead.
For example, revoking all privileges from user `jdoe` can be done with the
following command:

```openCypher
  REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM jdoe;
```

Finally, obtaining the status of each privilege for a certain user or role can be
done by issuing the following command:

```openCypher
  SHOW PRIVILEGES FOR user_or_role;
```
