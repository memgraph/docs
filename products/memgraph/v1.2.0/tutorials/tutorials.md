## Tutorials

Articles within the tutorials section serve as real-world examples of using
Memgraph. These articles tend to provide the user with a reasonably-sized
dataset and some example queries that showcase how to use Memgraph on that
particular dataset. We encourage all Memgraph users to go through at least
one of the tutorials as they can also serve as a verification that Memgraph
is successfully installed on your system.

So far we have covered the following topics with basic tutorials:

  * [Analyzing TED Talks](analyzing-TED-talks.md)
  * [Graphing the Premier League](graphing-the-premier-league.md)
