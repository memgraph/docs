## How-to Guides Overview

Articles within the this section serve as a cookbook for getting
things done as fast as possible. These articles tend to provide a step-by-step
guide on how to use certain Memgraph features or solve a particular problem.

### Importing data

Data can be imported from CSV files using the CSV Import Tool or by using openCypher queries. 
Take a look at the [Import data](database_functionalities/import-data.md) guide.

### Query modules

Memgraph supports extending the query language with user-written procedures. 
These procedures are grouped into modules, which can then be loaded either on startup or later on. 
To learn more about query modules take a look at the following guides:
* [Built-in query modules](database_functionalities/query_modules/built-in-query-modules.md)
* [Load and call query modules](database_functionalities/query_modules/load-call-query-modules.md)
* [Implement custom query modules](database_functionalities/query_modules/implement-query-modules.md)
