## Profiling queries

Along with inspecting a query's plan as described in the [Inspecting queries](./inspecting-queries.md), 
it is also possible to profile the execution of a query and get a detailed report 
on how the query's plan behaved. For every logical operator the following info is provided:

- `OPERATOR` &mdash; the name of the operator, just like in the output of an
  `EXPLAIN` query.

- `ACTUAL HITS` &mdash; the number of times a particular logical operator was
  pulled from.

- `RELATIVE TIME` &mdash; the amount of time that was spent processing a
  particular logical operator, relative to the execution of the whole plan.

- `ABSOLUTE TIME` &mdash; the amount of time that was spent processing a
  particular logical operator.

A simple example to illustrate the output:

```opencypher
PROFILE MATCH (n :Node)-[:Edge]-(m :Node) WHERE n.prop = 42 RETURN *;
```

+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| OPERATOR      | ACTUAL HITS   | RELATIVE TIME | ABSOLUTE TIME |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
