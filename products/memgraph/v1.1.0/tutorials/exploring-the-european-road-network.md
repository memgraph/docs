## Exploring the European Road Network

This article is a part of a series intended to show users how to use Memgraph
on real-world data and, by doing so, retrieve some interesting and useful
information.

### Introduction

This particular article outlines how to use some of Memgraph's built-in graph
algorithms. More specifically, the article shows how to use breadth-first search
graph traversal algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding weighted
shortest paths between nodes in the graph.

### Data model

One of the most common applications of graph traversal algorithms is driving
route computation, so we will use European road network graph as an example.
The graph consists of 999 major European cities from 39 countries in total.
Each city is connected to the country it belongs to via an edge of type `:In_`.
There are edges of type `:Road` connecting cities less than 500 kilometers
apart. Distance between cities is specified in the `length` property of the
edge.

### Importing the Snapshot

We have prepared a database snapshot for this example, so the user can easily
import it when starting Memgraph using the `--data-directory` option.

```plaintext
sudo -u memgraph \
  /usr/lib/memgraph/memgraph --data-directory /usr/share/memgraph/examples/Europe \
    --storage-snapshot-interval-sec=0 --storage-wal-enabled=false \
    --storage-snapshot-on-exit=false --storage-properties-on-edges=true
```

When using Memgraph installed from DEB or RPM package, the currently running
Memgraph server may need to be stopped before importing the example. The user
can do so using the following command:

```plaintext
systemctl stop memgraph
```

When using Docker, the example can be imported with the following command:

```plaintext
docker run -p 7687:7687 \
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph \
  memgraph --data-directory /usr/share/memgraph/examples/Europe \
  --storage-snapshot-interval-sec=0 --storage-wal-enabled=false \
  --storage-snapshot-on-exit=false --storage-properties-on-edges=true
```

The user should note that any modifications of the database state will persist
only during this run of Memgraph.

### Example Queries

1) Let's list all of the countries in our road network.

```opencypher
MATCH (c:Country) RETURN c.name ORDER BY c.name;
```

2) Which Croatian cities are in our road network?

```opencypher
MATCH (c:City)-[:In_]->(:Country {name: "Croatia"})
RETURN c.name ORDER BY c.name;
```

3) Which cities in our road network are less than 200 km away from Zagreb?

```opencypher
MATCH (:City {name: "Zagreb"})-[r:Road]->(c:City)
WHERE r.length < 200
RETURN c.name ORDER BY c.name;
```

Now let's try some queries using Memgraph's graph traversal capabilities.

4) Say you want to drive from Zagreb to Paris. You might wonder, what is the
least number of cities you have to visit if you don't want to drive more than
500 kilometers between stops. Since the edges in our road network don't connect
cities that are more than 500 km apart, this is a great use case for the
breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

```opencypher
MATCH p = (:City {name: "Zagreb"})
          -[:Road * bfs]->
          (:City {name: "Paris"})
RETURN nodes(p);
```

5) What if we want to bike to Paris instead of driving? It is unreasonable (and
dangerous!) to bike 500 km per day. Let's limit ourselves to biking no more
than 200 km in one go.

```opencypher
MATCH p = (:City {name: "Zagreb"})
          -[:Road * bfs (e, v | e.length <= 200)]->
          (:City {name: "Paris"})
RETURN nodes(p);
```

"What is this special syntax?", you might wonder.

`(e, v | e.length <= 200)` is called a *filter lambda*. It's a function that
takes an edge symbol `e` and a vertex symbol `v` and decides whether this edge
and vertex pair should be considered valid in breadth-first expansion by
returning true or false (or Null). In the above example, lambda is returning
true if edge length is not greater than 200, because we don't want to bike more
than 200 km in one go.

6) Let's say we also don't want to visit Vienna on our way to Paris, because we
have a lot of friends there and visiting all of them would take up a lot of our
time. We just have to update our filter lambda.

```opencypher
MATCH p = (:City {name: "Zagreb"})
          -[:Road * bfs (e, v | e.length <= 200 AND v.name != "Vienna")]->
          (:City {name: "Paris"})
RETURN nodes(p);
```

As you can see, without the additional restriction we could visit 11 cities. If
we want to avoid Vienna, we must visit at least 12 cities.

7) Instead of counting the cities visited, we might want to find the shortest
paths in terms of distance travelled. This is a textbook application of
Dijkstra's algorithm. The following query will return the list of cities on the
shortest path from Zagreb to Paris along with the total length of the path.

```opencypher
MATCH p = (:City {name: "Zagreb"})
          -[:Road * wShortest (e, v | e.length) total_weight]->
          (:City {name: "Paris"})
RETURN nodes(p) as cities, total_weight;
```

As you can see, the syntax is quite similar to breadth-first search syntax.
Instead of a filter lambda, we need to provide a *weight lambda* and the *total
weight symbol*. Given an edge and vertex pair, weight lambda must return the
cost of expanding to the given vertex using the given edge. The path returned
will have the smallest possible sum of costs and it will be stored in the total
weight symbol. A limitation of Dijkstra's algorithm is that the cost must be
non-negative.

8) We can also combine weight and filter lambdas in the shortest-path query.
Let's say we're interested in the shortest path that doesn't require travelling
more that 200 km in one go for our bike route.

```opencypher
MATCH p = (:City {name: "Zagreb"})
      -[:Road * wShortest (e, v | e.length) total_weight (e, v | e.length <= 200)]->
      (:City {name: "Paris"})
RETURN nodes(p) as cities, total_weight;
```

9) Let's try and find 10 cities that are furthest away from Zagreb.

```opencypher
MATCH (:City {name: "Zagreb"})
      -[:Road * wShortest (e, v | e.length) total_weight]->
      (c:City)
RETURN c, total_weight
ORDER BY total_weight DESC LIMIT 10;
```

It is not surprising to see that they are all in Siberia.
