## How to Query HA Memgraph Programmatically?

If you have successfully
[configured HA Memgraph](install-configure-and-run-ha-memgraph.md) along with
the proxy setup, the process of programmatic querying should be exactly the
same as it would be to query the single node Memgraph instance.

### Supported Languages

If users wish to query HA Memgraph programmatically, they can do so using the
[Bolt protocol](https://boltprotocol.org) proxy server. Bolt was designed for
efficient communication with graph databases and Memgraph supports
[Version 1](https://boltprotocol.org/v1) of the protocol. Bolt protocol drivers
for some popular programming languages are listed below:

  * [C#](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver)
  * [C/C++](https://github.com/memgraph/mgclient)
  * [Go](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver)
  * [Haskell](https://github.com/zmactep/hasbolt)
  * [Java](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver)
  * [JavaScript](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver)
  * [Node.js](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver)
  * [PHP](https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-bolt-php)
  * [Python](https://github.com/memgraph/pymgclient)
  * [Ruby](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j)
  * [Rust](https://github.com/memgraph/rsmgclient)

### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

Secure connections are supported and enabled by default. The proxy server
initially ships with a self-signed testing certificate. The certificate can be
replaced by editing the following parameters in
`/etc/memgraph/memgraph_ha_proxy.conf`:

```
--cert-file=/path/to/ssl/client_cert.pem
--key-file=/path/to/ssl/client_key.pem
```

To disable SSL support and use insecure connections to the database proxy you
should set the mentioned parameters to empty values.

### Examples

In this article we have included some basic usage examples for the following
supported languages:

  * [Python](#python-example)
  * [Java](#java-example)
  * [JavaScript](#javascript-example)
  * [C#](#c-sharp-example)

Examples for the languages listed above are equivalent.

#### Python Example

Neo4j officially supports Python for interacting with an openCypher and Bolt
compliant database. For details consult the
[official documentation](http://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver) and the
[GitHub project](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver).

The code snippet below outlines a basic usage example which connects to the
database and executes a couple of elementary queries.

```python
from neo4j.v1 import GraphDatabase, basic_auth

# Initialize and configure the driver.
#   * provide the correct URL where Memgraph HA proxy is reachable;
#   * use an empty user name and password.
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687",
                              auth=basic_auth("", ""))

# Start a session in which queries are executed.
session = driver.session()

# Execute openCypher queries.
# After each query, call either `consume()` or `data()`
session.run('CREATE (alice:Person {name: "Alice", age: 22})').consume()

# Get all the vertices from the database (potentially multiple rows).
vertices = session.run('MATCH (n) RETURN n').data()
# Assuming we started with an empty database, we should have Alice
# as the only row in the results.
only_row = vertices.pop()
alice = only_row["n"]

# Print out what we retrieved.
print("Found a vertex with labels '{}', name '{}' and age {}".format(
  alice['name'], alice.labels, alice['age'])

# Remove all the data from the database.
session.run('MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n').consume()

# Close the session and the driver.
session.close()
driver.close()
```

#### Java Example

The details about Java driver can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver).

The code snippet below outlines a basic usage example which connects to the
database and executes a couple of elementary queries.

```java
import org.neo4j.driver.v1.*;
import org.neo4j.driver.v1.types.*;
import static org.neo4j.driver.v1.Values.parameters;
import java.util.*;

public class JavaQuickStart {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize driver.
        Config config = Config.build().toConfig();
        Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687",
                                             AuthTokens.basic("",""),
                                             config);
        // Execute basic queries.
        try (Session session = driver.session()) {
            StatementResult rs1 = session.run("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n");
            StatementResult rs2 = session.run(
                "CREATE (alice: Person {name: 'Alice', age: 22})");
            StatementResult rs3 = session.run( "MATCH (n) RETURN n");
            List<Record> records = rs3.list();
            Record record = records.get(0);
            Node node = record.get("n").asNode();
            System.out.println(node.get("name").asString());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            System.exit(1);
        }
        // Cleanup.
        driver.close();
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript Example

The details about Javascript driver can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver).

Here is an example related to `Node.js`. Memgraph HA proxy doesn't have
integrated support for `WebSocket` which is required during the execution in any
web browser. If you want to run `openCypher` queries from a web browser,
[websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) has to be up and running.
Requests from web browsers are wrapped into `WebSocket` messages, and a proxy
is needed to handle the overhead. The proxy has to be configured to point out
to Memgraph HA proxy's Bolt port and web browser driver has to send requests to
the proxy port.

The code snippet below outlines a basic usage example which connects to the
database and executes a couple of elementary queries.

```javascript
var neo4j = require('neo4j-driver').v1;
var driver = neo4j.driver("bolt://localhost:7687",
                          neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", "1234"));
var session = driver.session();

function die() {
  session.close();
  driver.close();
}

function run_query(query, callback) {
  var run = session.run(query, {});
  run.then(callback).catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
    die();
  });
}

run_query("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n", function (result) {
  console.log("Database cleared.");
  run_query("CREATE (alice: Person {name: 'Alice', age: 22})", function (result) {
    console.log("Record created.");
    run_query("MATCH (n) RETURN n", function (result) {
      console.log("Record matched.");
      var alice = result.records[0].get("n");
      console.log(alice.labels[0]);
      console.log(alice.properties["name"]);
      session.close();
      driver.close();
    });
  });
});
```

#### C# Example {#c-sharp-example}

The details about C# driver can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver).

The code snipped below outlines a basic usage example which connects to the
database and executes a couple of elementary queries.

```csh
using System;
using System.Linq;
using Neo4j.Driver.V1;

public class Basic {
  public static void Main(string[] args) {
    // Initialize the driver.
    var config = Config.DefaultConfig;
    using(var driver = GraphDatabase.Driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.None, config))
      using(var session = driver.Session())
      {
        // Run basic queries.
        session.Run("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n").Consume();
        session.Run("CREATE (alice:Person {name: \"Alice\", age: 22})").Consume();
        var result = session.Run("MATCH (n) RETURN n").First();
        var alice = (INode) result["n"];
        Console.WriteLine(alice["name"]);
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", alice.Labels));
        Console.WriteLine(alice["age"]);
      }
    Console.WriteLine("All ok!");
  }
}
```
