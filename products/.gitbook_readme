## Memgraph Cloud

To offer its users more flexibility and a better experience, Memgraph provides
fully managed graph DBMS as a service (in the Cloud). Users do not need to set
up or maintain a database instance. It is Memgraph's responsibility to oversee
the infrastructure (deployment, upgrade, update, removal, data backup,
security, etc.).
