## Create Memgraph Cloud account

To create Memgraph Cloud account:

1. Go to [Memgraph Cloud sign-up](https://cloud.memgraph.com/signup) page.
2. Provide your personal information, set up a password and accept the terms of
   service. 
3. Verify your email address by clicking on the link in the email you got from
   Memgraph.
4. Before you start using Cloud, help us by choosing a programming language you
   prefer. In return, we can direct our support better, and adding languages
   that we havenâ€™t listed helps us leave no man behind once a user base is
   established.

You can also register to Memgraph Cloud with your Google account.

As a new user, you will start using a 14-day free trial version of Memgraph
Cloud, in which you can create one project that uses up to 2GB RAM. 

If you require more compute, enter a valid payment method and upgrade your
project.

Below is a demo video made for the launch that will take you through setting up
the Cloud account:

## Retrieve Memgraph Cloud project password

Each project within your Memgraph Cloud has its password. The project
password is not the same password you use to log into Memgraph Cloud. Memgraph
**doesn't have access** to those credentials and can't retrieve lost credentials
for Memgraph Cloud projects.

Below is a demo video made for the launch that will explain the importance of
Memgraph Cloud project password:

## Manage payment methods

In the **Account** section of Memgraph Cloud you can **Add Credit Card**,
**Redeem Code** or switch to the **Invoice** tab to check paid and due invoices.
