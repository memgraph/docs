### What is Memgraph?

**[Memgraph](/memgraph)** is a native in-memory graph streaming
platform built to handle real-time use-cases at enterprise scale. Memgraph
supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions and uses the standardized
**Cypher** query language for structuring, manipulating, and exploring data. You
can [connect to Kafka](/memgraph/import-data/kafka) and use Memgraph to wrangle
your graph data source.

### What is MAGE?

**[MAGE](/mage)** stands for **Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions**. Itâ€™s an
open-source project started by Memgraph that encourages developers to share
innovative and useful **[query modules](/mage/query-modules/available-queries)**
(custom Cypher procedures) so the whole community can benefit from them.

### What are query modules?

**[Query modules](/mage/query-modules/available-queries)** are essentially
collections of custom Cypher procedures that extend the basic functionalities of
the Cypher query language. Each query module consists of procedures that are
connected by a common theme (community detection for example). You can [implement
query modules](/mage/usage/loading-modules) using Python or C API.

### What is Cypher?

**[Cypher](/cypher-manual)** is a **graph query language** that allows users to store and retrieve
data from a graph database.
