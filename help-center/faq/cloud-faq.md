coupon.

### What will happen to my instance after the free trial?

## Projects

### Why can't I create more than 3 projects and 5 snapshots? 
That is the initial limit for new users. If you want to create more projects,
[let us know](/help-center).

### Is it possible to upgrade a project to use more RAM?  
Yes, it is. You can find detailed instructions in [Memgraph Cloud
documentation](/docs/memgraph-cloud/cloud-projects#resize-a-project).

### I've created a project with 2GB RAM, but Memgraph Labs says there is only 1.54GB available. Why is that so?
A par of RAM is allocated to the operating system and other services. They
usually take 13-15% of the total RAM. Approximate free RAM is: 
- 1GB RAM Memgraph Cloud project has about 860 MB free RAM
- 2GB RAM Memgraph Cloud project has about 1.60 GB free RAM
- 4GB RAM Memgraph Cloud project has about 3.40 GB free RAM
- 8GB RAM Memgraph Cloud project has about 6.7 GB free RAM
- 16GB RAM Memgraph Cloud project has about 14 GB free RAM
- 32GB RAM Memgraph Cloud project has about 28 GB free RAM

### I've created a new project, and when I try to connect to the instance, I get an error: Unable to connect.
Upon creating a project, Memgraph loads all the MAGE algorithms, so it takes
some time to load them all. Wait 30 seconds, and then try to connect again.

### I’ve paused my project and resumed it, but my Memgraph’s IP is different now? 
When you pause your project, usually the IP stays the same, but sometimes your
IP can be released and a new one will be allocated. You can always check the IP
in the connection details. 

### How can I retrieve my project password?
If you have forgotten your project password, we can't help you. We don't have a
way of finding out or resetting your project password.

### How can I connect to my project?
You can connect to an instance running within the Memgraph Cloud project via
**Memgraph Lab**, a visual interface, **mgconsole**, command-line interface, or
one of many drivers. You can find detailed instructions in [Memgraph Cloud
documentation](/docs/memgraph-cloud/cloud-connect).

### How can I backup my project?
A project is backed up by creating a snapshot with Amazon EBS. You cannot create
a snapshot if you are using a 14-day free trial version of Memgraph Cloud. You
can find detailed instructions in [Memgraph Cloud
documentation](/docs/memgraph-cloud/cloud-projects#back-up-a-project).
