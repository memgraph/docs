### What is Memgraph Lab?

Memgraph Lab is a visual interface for exploring and interacting with data
stored in Memgraph.

If you prefer to query Memgraph using a command-line tool, use
[mgconsole](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph/mgconsole). 

### Can I only use Memgraph Lab?

No. Memgraph Lab needs a running Memgraph instance in the background to be able to
connect to it. After you have [installed Memgraph
platform](/memgraph/installation) and started it, you can head over to Memgraph
Lab and start querying your graph.

### How to install Memgraph Lab on Windows?

You can either [install Memgraph
Platform](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/install-memgraph-on-windows-docker),
which includes both Memgraph Lab and Memgraph DB (as well as a command-line tool
mgconsole and MAGE library) or [Memgraph
Lab](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-lab/installation/windows) by itself, but
please remember you need a running Memgraph DB instance to connect to. 

Memgraph Platform is installed using **Docker** that enables us to
run Memgraph virtually on any system without having to worry about compatibility
issues. You don't have to be familiar with Docker to try out Memgraph Platform, so
[install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) without fear.
