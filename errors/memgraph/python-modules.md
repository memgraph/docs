## How to install Python packages globally? {#error-1}

The Python packages need to be installed globally for Memgraph to access them.
To install a Python module globally, you will need to run it with the following
command:

```console
sudo pip3 install <PACKAGE_NAME>
```

If this aproach doesn't work, try to install a pre-compiled package using
`apt-get` if available.
