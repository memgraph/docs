## Errors

1. [Skipping duplicate node with ID '{}'. For more details, visit:
   memgr.ph/csv-import-tool.](#error-1)
2. [Skipping bad relationship with START_ID '{}'. For more details, visit:
   memgr.ph/csv-import-tool.](#error-2)
3. [Skipping bad relationship with END_ID '{}'. For more details, visit:
   memgr.ph/csv-import-tool.](#error-3)

## Skipping duplicate node with ID {} {#error-1}

Duplicate nodes are nodes that have an ID that is the same as another node that
was already imported. You can instruct the importer to ignore all duplicate
nodes (instead of raising an error) by using the `--skip-duplicate-nodes` flag.

## Skipping bad relationship with START_ID {} {#error-2}

A node with the id `START_ID` doesn't exist. You can instruct the importer to
ignore all bad relationships (instead of raising an error) that refer to nodes
that don't exist in the node files by using the `--skip-bad-relationships` flag.

## Skipping bad relationship with END_ID {} {#error-3}

A node with the id `END_ID` doesn't exist. You can instruct the importer to
ignore all bad relationships (instead of raising an error) that refer to nodes
that don't exist in the node files by using the `--skip-bad-relationships` flag.
