Estimating Memgraph's storage memory usage is not entirely straightforward
because it depends on a lot of variables, but it is possible to do so quite
accurately. Below is an example that will try to show the basic reasoning.

If you want to **estimate** the storage memory usage, use the following formula:

$\texttt{StorageRAMUsage} = \texttt{NumberOfVertices} \times 260\text{B} + \texttt{NumberOfEdges} \times 180\text{B}$

Let's test this formula on the [Marvel Comic Universe Social Network
dataset](https://memgraph.com/download/datasets/marvel-cinematic-universe/marvel-cinematic-universe.cypherl.gz),
which is also available as a dataset inside Memgraph Lab and contains 21,723
vertices and 682,943 edges. 

According to the formula, storage memory usage should be: 

$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{StorageRAMUsage} &= 21,723 \times 260\text{B} + 682,943 \times 180\text{B} \\ &= 5,647,980\text{B} + 122,929,740\text{B}\\ &= 128,577,720\text{B} \approx 125\text{MB}
\end{aligned}
$

Now, let's run an empty Memgraph instance on a x86 Ubuntu. It consumes **~75MB**
of RAM due to baseline runtime overhead. Once the dataset is loaded, RAM usage
rises up to **~260MB**. Memory usage primarily consists of storage and query
execution memory usage. After executing `FREE MEMORY` query to force the cleanup
of query execution, the RAM usage drops to **~200MB**. If the baseline runtime
overhead of **75MB** is subtracted from the total memory usage of the dataset,
which is **200MB**, and storage memory usage comes up to **~125MB**, which shows
that the formula is correct.

## The calculation in detail

Let's dive deeper into the memory usage values. Because Memgraph works on the
x86 architecture, calculations are based on the x86 Linux memory usage.

:::

Each `Vertex` and `Edge` object has a pointer to a `Delta` object. The
`Delta` object stores all changes on a certain `Vertex` or `Edge` and that's
why `Vertex` and `Edge` memory usage will be increased by the memory of
the `Delta` objects they are pointing to. If there are few updates, there are
also few `Delta` objects because the latest data is stored in the object.
But, if the database has a lot of concurrent operations, many `Delta` objects
will be created. Of course, the `Delta` objects will be kept in memory as long as
needed, and a bit more, because of the internal GC inefficiencies.

### `Delta` memory layout

Each `Delta` object has a least **104B**.

### `Vertex` memory layout

Each `Vertex` object has at least **112B** + **104B** for the `Delta` object, in
total, a minimum of **216B**.

Each additional label takes **8B**. 

Keep in mind that three labels take as much space as four labels, and five to
seven labels take as much space as eight labels, etc., due to the dynamic
memory allocation.  

### `Edge` memory layout

Each `Edge` object has at least **40B** + **104B** for the `Delta` object, in
total, a minimum of **144B**.

### `SkipList` memory layout

Each object (`Vertex`, `Edge`) is placed inside a data structure
called a `SkipList`. The `SkipList` has an additional overhead in terms of
`SkipListNode` structure and `next_pointers`. Each `SkipListNode` has an
additional **8B** element overhead and another **8B** for each of the `next_pointers`.

It is impossible to know the exact number of **next_pointers** upfront, and
consequently the total size, but it's never more than **double the number of
objects** because the number of pointers is generated by binomial distribution
(take a look at [the source
code](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/blob/master/src/utils/skip_list.hpp)
for details).

### Index memory layout

Each `LabelIndex::Entry` object has exactly **16B**.

Depending on the actual value stored, each `LabelPropertyIndex::Entry` has at least **72B**.

Objects of both types are placed into the `SkipList`.

#### Each index object in total

- `SkipListNode<LabelIndex::Entry>` object has **24B**.
- `SkipListNode<LabelPropertyIndex::Entry>` has at least **80B**.
- Each `SkipListNode` has an additional **16B** because of the **next_pointers**.

### Properties

All properties use **1B** for metadata - type, size of property ID and the size
of payload in the case of `NULL` and `BOOLEAN` values, or size of payload size
indicator for other types (how big is the stored value, for example, integers
can be 1B, 2B 4B or 8b depending on their value). 

Then they take up **another byte** for storing property ID, which means each
property takes up at least 2B. After those 2B, some properties (for example,
`STRING` values) store addition metadata. And lastly, all properties store the
value. So the layout of each property is:


$\texttt{propertySize} = \texttt{basicMetadata} + \texttt{propertyID} + [\texttt{additionalMetadata}] + \texttt{value}.$


|Value type       |Size                            |Note
|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`NULL`           |1B + 1B                         | The value is written in the first byte of the basic metadata.                                       |
|`BOOL`           |1B + 1B                         | The value is written in the first byte of the basic metadata.
|`INT`            |1B + 1B + 1B, 2B, 4B or 8B      | Basic metadata, property ID and the value depending on the size of the integer.                     |
|`DOUBLE`         |1B + 1B + 8B                    | Basic metadata, property ID and the value                                                           |
|`STRING`         |1B + 1B + 1B + min 1B           | Basic metadata, property ID, additional metadata and lastly the value depending on the size of the string, where 1 ASCII character in the string takes up 1B.|
|`LIST`           |1B + 1B + 1B + min 1B           | Basic metadata, property ID, additional metadata and the total size depends on the number and size of the values in the list.|
|`MAP`            |1B + 1B + 1B + min 1B           | Basic metadata, property ID, additional metadata and the total size depends on the number and size of the values in the map.|
|`TEMPORAL_DATA`  |1B + 1B + 1B + min 1B + min 1B  | Basic metadata, property ID, additional metadata, seconds, microseconds. Value od the seconds and microseconds is at least 1B, but probably 4B in most cases due to the large values they store.|

### Marvel dataset use case

The Marvel dataset consists of `Hero`, `Comic` and `ComicSeries` labels, which
are indexed. There are also three label-property indices - on the `name`
property of `Hero` and `Comic` vertices, and on the `title` property of
`ComicSeries` vertices. The `ComicSeries` vertices also have the `publishYear`
property.

 <img src={require('../data/under-the-hood/marvel-dataset-schema.png').default}/>

There are 6487 `Hero` and 12,661 `Comic` vertices with the property `name`.
That's 19,148 vertices in total. To calculate how much storage those vertices
and properties occupy, we are going to use the following formula:

$\texttt{NumberOfVertices} \times (\texttt{Vertex} + \texttt{properties} + \texttt{SkipListNode} + \texttt{next\_pointers} + \texttt{Delta}).$

Let's assume the name on average has $3\text{B}+10\text{B} = 13\text{B}$ (each
name is on average 10 characters long). One the average values are included, the
calculation is:

$19,148 \times (112\text{B} + 13\text{B} + 16\text{B} + 16\text{B} + 104\text{B}) = 19,148 \times 261\text{B} = 4,997,628\text{B}.$

The remaining 2,584 vertices are the `ComicSeries` vertices with the `title` and
`publishYear` properties. Let's assume that the `title` property is
approximately the same length as the `name` property. The `publishYear` property
is a list of integers. The average length of the `publishYear` list is 2.17,
let's round it up to 3 elements. Since the year is an integer, 2B for each
integer will be more than enough, plus the 2B for the metadata. Therefore, each
list occupies $3 \times 2\text{B} \times 2\text{B} = 12\text{B}$. Using the same
formula as above, but being careful to include both `title` and `publishYear`
properties, the calculation is:

$2584 \times (112\text{B} + 13\text{B} + 12\text{B} + 16\text{B} + 16\text{B} + 104\text{B}) = 2584 \times 273\text{B} = 705,432\text{B}.$

In total, $5,703,060\text{B}$ to store vertices.

The edges don't have any properties on them, so the formula is as follows:

$\texttt{NumberOfEdges} \times (\texttt{Edge} + \texttt{SkipListNode} + \texttt{next\_pointers} + \texttt{Delta}).$

There are 682,943 edges in the Marvel dataset. Hence, we have:

$682,943 \times (40\text{B}+16\text{B}+16\text{B}+104\text{B}) = 682,943 \times 176\text{B} = 120,197,968\text{B}.$

Next, `Hero`, `Comic` and `ComicSeries` labels have label indices. To calculate
how much space they take up, use the following formula:

$\texttt{NumberOfLabelIndices} \times \texttt{NumberOfVertices} \times (\texttt{SkipListNode<LabelIndex::Entry>} + \texttt{next\_pointers}).$

Since there are three label indices, we have the following calculation:

$3 \times 21,723 \times (24\text{B}+16\text{B}) = 65,169 \times 40\text{B} = 2,606,760\text{B}.$

For label-property index, labeled property needs to be taken into account.
Property `name` is indexed on `Hero` and `Comic` vertices, while property
`title` is indexed on `ComicSeries` vertices. We already assumed that the
`title` property is approximately the same length as the `name` property. 

Here is the formula:

$\texttt{NumberOfLabelPropertyIndices} \times \texttt{NumberOfVertices} \times (\texttt{SkipListNode<LabelIndex::Entry>} + \texttt{property} + \texttt{next\_pointers}).$

When the appropriate values are included, the calculation is:

$3 \times 21,723 \times (80\text{B}+13\text{B}+16\text{B})= 65,169 \times 109\text{B} = 7,103,421\text{B}.$

Now let's sum up everything we calculated:

$5,703,060\text{B} + 120,197,968\text{B} + 2,606,760\text{B} + 7,103,421\text{B} = 135,611,209 \text{B} \approx 130\text{MB}.$

Bear in mind the number can vary because objects can have higher overhead due to
the additional data.

## Query Execution memory Usage

Query execution also uses up RAM. In some cases, intermediate results are
aggregated to return valid query results and the query execution memory can end
up using a large amount of RAM. Keep in mind that query execution memory
monotonically grows in size during the execution, and it's freed once the query
execution is done. A general rule of thumb is to have double the RAM than what
the actual dataset is occupying.

## Configuration options to reduce memory usage

Here are several tips how you can reduce memory usage and increase scalability:

1. Consider removing label index by executing `DROP INDEX ON :Label;` 
2. Consider removing label-property index by executing `DROP INDEX
   ON :Label(property);` 
3. If you don't have properties on relationships, disable them in the
   configuration file by setting the `-storage-properties-on-edges` flag to
   `false`. This can significantly reduce memory usage because effectively
   `Edge` objects will not be created, and all information will be inlined under
   `Vertex` objects. You can disable properties on relationships with a
   non-empty database, if the relationships are without properties. If you need
   help with adapting the configuration to your needs, check out the the how-to
   guide on [changing configuration settings](/how-to-guides/config-logs.md).
