Memgraph can natively ingest streaming data from upstream sources using [Apache
Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org), [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) and
[Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/).

[![Related - Reference Guide](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Related&message=Reference%20Guide&color=yellow&style=for-the-badge)](/reference-guide/streams/overview.md)

The following pages instruct how to connect to data streams to ingest the data
and manage the connection using:
- [Cypher queries](/import-data/data-streams/manage-streams.md)
- [a wizard in the **Stream** section of Memgraph Lab](/import-data/data-streams/manage-streams-lab.md)
