If you define an application with **Docker Compose**, you can use that
definition to run the application in CI, staging, or production environments.
Here you can find `docker-compose.yml` files necessary to run [**Memgraph
Platform**](#docker-compose-for-memgraph-platform-image), [**Memgraph
MAGE**](#docker-compose-for-memgraph-mage-image) and
[**Memgraph**](#docker-compose-for-memgraph-image) images.

## Docker Compose for Memgraph Platform image

The **Memgraph Platform** image contains:

- **MemgraphDB** - the database that holds your data
- **Memgraph Lab** - visual user interface for running queries and visualizing
  graph data
- **mgconsole** - command-line interface for running queries
- **MAGE** - graph algorithms and modules library

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  memgraph-platform:
    image: "memgraph/memgraph-platform"
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"
      - "3000:3000"
      - "7444:7444"
    volumes:
      - mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph
      - mg_log:/var/log/memgraph
      - mg_etc:/etc/memgraph
    environment:
      - MEMGRAPH="--log-level=TRACE"
    entrypoint: ["/usr/bin/supervisord"]
volumes:
  mg_lib:
  mg_log:
  mg_etc:
```

The port `7687` is used for communication with Memgraph via Bolt protocol. The
port `3000` is exposed because Memgraph Lab will be running on `localhost:3000`,
while the port `7444` is there so that you can see logs from Memgraph inside
Memgraph Lab. We specified three useful volumes:

- `mg_lib` - directory containing data that enables data persistency
- `mg_log` - directory containing log files
- `mg_etc` - directory containing the configuration file

The exact location of the local directories depends on your specific setup.

[Configuration settings](/reference-guide/configuration.md) can be changed by
setting the value of the `MEMGRAPH` environment variable. In the above example,
you can see how to set `--log-level` to `TRACE`. Since Memgraph Platform is not
a single service, the process manager
[`supervisord`](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/)
is used as the main running process in the `entrypoint`. The MAGE library is
included in this image, so you can use the available graph algorithms.

## Docker Compose for Memgraph MAGE image

The **Memgraph MAGE** image contains:

- **MemgraphDB** - the database that holds your data
- **MAGE** - graph algorithms and modules library

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  memgraph-mage:
    image: "memgraph/memgraph-mage"
    volumes:
      - mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph
      - mg_log:/var/log/memgraph
      - mg_etc:/etc/memgraph
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"
      - "7444:7444"
    entrypoint: ["/usr/lib/memgraph/memgraph", "--log-level=TRACE"]
volumes:
  mg_lib:
  mg_log:
  mg_etc:
```

The port `7687` is used for communication with Memgraph via Bolt protocol, while
the port `7444` is there so that you can see logs from Memgraph inside the
Memgraph Lab application. We specified three useful volumes:

- `mg_lib` - directory containing data that enables data persistency
- `mg_log` - directory containing log files
- `mg_etc` - directory containing the configuration file

The exact location of the local directories depends on your specific setup.

[Configuration settings](/reference-guide/configuration.md) can be changed by
adding the `entrypoint`. You first need to add `/usr/lib/memgraph/memgraph` and
then the configuration setting you'd like to change. In the above example, you
can see how to set `--log-level` to `TRACE`. Since the MAGE library is included
in this image, you can use the available graph algorithms.

then the configuration setting you'd like to change. In the above example, you
can see how to set `--log-level` to `TRACE`. Since this image doesn't have the
MAGE library included, you won't be able to use graph algorithms.
