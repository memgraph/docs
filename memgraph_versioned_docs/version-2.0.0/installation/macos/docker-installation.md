This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run
Memgraph on Linux with Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation guide, make sure that you have:
- Installed **Docker Desktop**. Instructions on how to install Docker can be found on
  the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

:::info
Memgraph's Docker image was built with **Docker version `1.12`** and
should be compatible with all newer versions.
:::

## Installation guide {#installation-guide}

You can either manually download the Memgraph Docker image or use the convenient
`docker pull memgraph/memgraph-platform` command, which we recommend.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  groupId="docker-method"
  defaultValue="pull"
  values={[
    {label: 'Pull Docker image', value: 'pull'},
    {label: 'Download Docker image manually', value: 'download'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="pull">

1. Download and load the **Memgraph Docker image** with the following command:

```console
 docker pull memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

2. Create a new tag for the image so it can be called as `memgraph` instead of
   `memgraph/memgraph-platform`:

```console
docker image tag memgraph/memgraph-platform memgraph
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="download">

1. Download the latest **Memgraph Docker image** from the [official download
   center](https://memgraph.com/download/).

2. If you installed Docker correctly, you can import the image using the
   following command:

```console
docker load -i /path-to/memgraph-<version>-docker.tar.gz
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Starting Memgraph

To start Memgraph, use the following command:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 memgraph
```

:::info Docker Volumes
Docker containers don‚Äôt persist data by default (all changes are lost when the
container is stopped). You need to use local volumes to store the data
permanently, which is why Memgraph is started with the `-v` flag.

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph
```

More information on Docker Volumes can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).
:::

If successful, you should see a message similar to the following :

```console
mgconsole X.X
Connected to 'memgraph://127.0.0.1:7687'
Type :help for shell usage
Quit the shell by typing Ctrl-D(eof) or :quit
memgraph>
```

If you want to start Memgraph with different configuration settings, check out
the [section below](#configuration). At this point, Memgraph is ready for you to [submit
queries](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx).

:::info
The username and password for connecting to the database are empty by default.
:::

## Stopping Memgraph

To stop a Memgraph database instance, run the following command:

```console
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
```

You can find the name of the container (`CONTAINER_NAME`) by running:

```console
docker ps
```

## Configuration

The Memgraph configuration is available in Docker's named volume `mg_etc`. On
Linux systems, it should be in
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf`. Keep in mind that this way
of specifying configuration options is only valid if Memgraph was started [using
volumes](#named-volumes).

When using Docker, you can also specify the configuration options in the `docker
run` command:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687" memgraph
```

To learn about all the configuration options, check out the [Reference
guide](/reference-guide/configuration.md).

## Named volumes

### Accessing configuration files and logs

If you need to access the Memgraph configuration file or logs, you will need to
specify the following volumes when starting Memgraph:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687" \
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph \
  -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph \
  -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph \
  memgraph
```

The volume `mg_etc` contains the configuration file while the logs will be saved
to `mg_log`. The location of the volume directories depends on your specific
setup.

### Reusing volumes between Memgraph versions

If it happens that the named volumes are reused between different Memgraph
versions, Docker will overwrite a folder within the container with existing data
from the host machine. If a new file is introduced, or two versions of Memgraph
are not compatible, some features might not work, or Memgraph might not be able
to work correctly. We strongly advise you to use different named volumes for
different Memgraph versions or to remove the existing volume from the host with
the following command:

```console
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```
