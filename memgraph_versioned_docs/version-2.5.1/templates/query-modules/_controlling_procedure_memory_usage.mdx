<!-- ## Controlling procedure memory usage -->

When running a procedure, Memgraph controls the maximum memory usage that the
procedure may consume during its execution.  By default, the upper memory limit
when running a procedure is `100 MB`.  If your query procedure requires more
memory to yield its results, you can increase the memory limit using the
following syntax:

```cypher
CALL module.procedure(arg1, arg2, ...) PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT 100 KB YIELD result;
CALL module.procedure(arg1, arg2, ...) PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT 100 MB YIELD result;
CALL module.procedure(arg1, arg2, ...) PROCEDURE MEMORY UNLIMITED YIELD result;
```

The limit can either be specified to a specific value (either in `KB` or in
`MB`), or it can be set to unlimited.
