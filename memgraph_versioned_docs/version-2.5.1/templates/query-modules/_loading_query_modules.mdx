<!-- ## Loading query modules -->

Once you start Memgraph, it will attempt to load query modules from all `*.so`
and `*.py` files from the default (`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` and
`/var/lib/memgraph/internal_modules`) directories. 

MAGE modules are located at
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` and custom modules developed via Memgraph Lab at
`/var/lib/memgraph/internal_modules`.

Memgraph can load query modules from additional directories, if their path is
added to the `--query-modules-directory` flag in the main configuration file
(`/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`) or supplied as a command-line parameter (e.g.
when using Docker). 

If you are supplying the additional directory as a parameter, do not forget to
include the path to `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`, otherwise queries from
that directory will not be loaded when Memgraph starts.

:::caution

When working with Docker and `memgraph-platform` image, you should pass
configuration flags inside of environment variables, for example:

```terminal
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--query-modules-directory=/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules,/usr/lib/memgraph/my_modules" memgraph/memgraph-platform`
```

If you are working with `memgraph` or `memgraph-mage` images you should pass
configuration options like this: 

```terminal
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --query-modules-directory=/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules,/usr/lib/memgraph/my_modules
```

:::

If a certain query module was added while Memgraph was already running, you need
to load it manually using the `mg.load("module_name")` procedure within a query:

```cypher
CALL mg.load("py_example");
```

If there is no response (no error message), the load was successful.

If you want to reload all existing modules and load any newly added ones, use
`mg.load_all()`:

```cypher
CALL mg.load_all();
```

If there is no response (no error message), the load was successful.

You can check if the query module has been loaded by using the `mg.procedures()`
procedure within a query:

```cypher
CALL mg.procedures() YIELD *;
```
