<!-- ## Calling query modules -->

Once the MAGE query modules or any custom modules you developed have been
loaded into Memgraph, you can call them within queries using the following Cypher
syntax:

```cypher
CALL module.procedure([optional parameter], arg1, "string_argument", ...) YIELD res1, res2, ...;
```
Every procedure has a first optional parameter and the rest of them depend on the procedure you are trying to call. The optional parameter must be result of the aggregation function [`project()`](/cypher-manual/functions#aggregation-functions). If such a parameter is provided, **all** operations will be executed on a projected graph. Otherwise, you will work on the whole graph stored inside Memgraph. 

Each procedure returns zero or more records, where each record contains named
fields. The `YIELD` clause is used to select fields you are interested in or all
of them (*). If you are not interested in any fields, omit the `YIELD` clause.
The procedure will still run, but the record fields will not be stored in
variables. If you are trying to `YIELD` fields that are not a part of the
produced record, the query will result in an error.

Procedures can be standalone as in the example above, or a part of a larger
query when we want the procedure to work on data the query is
producing. 

For example:

```cypher
MATCH (node) CALL module.procedure(node) YIELD result RETURN *;
```

When the `CALL` clause is a part of a larger query, results from the query are
returned using the `RETURN` clause. If the `CALL` clause is followed by a clause
that only updates the data and doesn't read it, `RETURN` is unnecessary. It is
the Cypher convention that read-only queries need to end with a `RETURN`, while
queries that update something don't need to `RETURN` anything.

Also, if the procedure itself writes into the database, all the rest of the
clauses in the query can only read from the database, and the `CALL` clause can
only be followed by the `YIELD` clause and/or `RETURN` clause. 

If a procedure returns a record with the same field name as some variable we
already have in the query, that field name can be aliased with some other name
using the `AS` sub-clause:

```cypher
MATCH (result) CALL module.procedure(42) YIELD result AS procedure_result RETURN *;
```
