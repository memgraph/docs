**MAGE**, also known as **Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions**, is an
open-source repository that contains graph algorithms in the form of **query
modules** written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and
contribute implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming
languages, all runnable inside Memgraph.

MAGE modules are located at `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`.

If you are using Docker and either `memgraph-platform` or `memgraph-mage`
images, the MAGE library is already loaded and ready to be used so you can skip to
the guide on [calling procedures within query
modules](load-call-query-modules#calling-query-modules).
