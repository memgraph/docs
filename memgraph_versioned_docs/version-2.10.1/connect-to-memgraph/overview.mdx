Memgraph supports the [**openCypher**](https://www.opencypher.org) query
language which has been developed by Neo4j. It is a declarative language
developed specifically for interaction with graph databases, which is currently
going through a vendor-independent standardization process. 

Cypher queries can be executed against Memgraph via:

- **[Memgraph Lab](/memgraph-lab)** - A lightweight and intuitive **visual user interface** that enables you to execute Cypher queries and visualize graph data.
- **[mgconsole](/connect-to-memgraph/mgconsole.md)** - A command-line interface for querying Memgraph.
- **[Drivers](/connect-to-memgraph/drivers/overview.md)**
- **[WebSocket](/connect-to-memgraph/websocket.md)**

## Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) {#secure-sockets-layer}

Secure connections are supported and disabled by default. The server initially
ships with a self-signed testing certificate located at `/etc/memgraph/ssl/`.
You can use it by [changing the configuration](/how-to-guides/config-logs.md) and passing its path within the
following parameters:

```
--bolt-cert-file=/etc/memgraph/ssl/cert.pem
--bolt-key-file=/etc/memgraph/ssl/key.pem
```

If you are using your own certificate be sure to enter the correct path to the
certificate.

To disable SSL support and use insecure connections to the database erase or
make comments out of both parameters (`--bolt-cert-file` and
`--bolt-key-file`) by adding a hashtag in front of them.

## Where to next?

You can also easily connect to an instance running in [Memgraph
Cloud](/memgraph-cloud). To learn more about the Cypher language, visit the
[Cypher manual](/cypher-manual) or [Memgraph
Playground](https://playground.memgraph.com) for interactive guides.
