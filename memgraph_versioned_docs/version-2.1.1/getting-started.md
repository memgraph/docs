## What is Memgraph?

Memgraph is a streaming graph application platform that helps you wrangle your
streaming data, build sophisticated models that you can query in real-time, and
develop applications you never thought possible in days, not months.

## Quick start

Are you eager to start working with Memgraph? Follow these three steps, and you
will have a full-running graph application platform in no time at all. Here is
what you need to do:

### 1. Download and install

Start your journey through the world of graph analytics by [downloading and
installing](/installation/overview.md) Memgraph. You can install Memgraph
natively on Linux and WSL or through Docker on Windows and macOS.

### 2. Connect to Memgraph

Once your Memgraph instance is up and running, you are ready to [connect to
Memgraph](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx). You can connect to Memgraph using
[drivers](/connect-to-memgraph/drivers/overview.md) for your favorite programming
language. If you are a command line fan, you can use
[mgconsole](/connect-to-memgraph/mgconsole.md) for querying. If you
prefer to do things in a visual way, go ahead and use [Memgraph
Lab](/memgraph-lab). The choice is up to you!

### 3. Import data

Now it is time to [import your data](/import-data/overview.mdx) into Memgraph.
Learn how you can import the data from different sources. Memgraph supports
importing [CSV files](/import-data/load-csv-clause.md), migration from SQL
databases like [PostgreSQL](/import-data/migrate/postgresql.md) and
[MySQL](/import-data/migrate/mysql.md), as well as [connections to data
streams](/import-data/kafka/overview.md) with Kafka, Pulsar and Redpanda.

## What to do next?

Now that you have seen how to install Memgraph and get your data into it, it is
time to discover even more possibilities that Memgraph offers. We have prepared
a lot of content for you. Pick your favorite one, or you can go through all of
them if you feel like it.

### Online playground (sandbox)

If you're interested in trying out Memgraph from the comfort of your browser,
you can do so on [Memgraph Playground](https://playground.memgraph.com/) or by
visiting the [Cypher manual](/cypher-manual).

### Step by step guide

Our [tutorials](/tutorials/overview.md) are the best place to start if you enjoy
learning concepts in small chunks before applying them in practice.

We have also prepared a cookbook for getting things done as fast as possible.
These articles provide a step-by-step guide on using certain [Memgraph features
or solving a particular problem](/how-to-guides/overview.md).

### Practical tutorial

Learning by doing is our mantra. Check out our [tutorial that uses real-world
data](/tutorials/analyzing-ted-talks.md). In this tutorial, you'll explore a
simple TED-talks dataset from scratch. The tips you'll learn in the tutorial
will help you build any graph application.

### Connect to Memgraph Cloud

Learn how to [connect your application](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx) to
the Memgraph Cloud. Let us manage the configuration and guarantee it's set up
correctly.

### Run an example streaming application

We've built an example streaming application to get you started quickly. Pull
the code from our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/memgraph/example-streaming-app) and get started.

### Video courses

Some people enjoy learning by watching audio-visual content. You can find the
best materials related to graphs and graphs analytics in our [list of
recommended
content](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ3HOJvHGxtQ_JHxOselBYg/playlists),
most of which is free.
