Articles within the tutorials section serve as real-world examples of using
Memgraph.

## Cypher and graph analytics tutorials

These articles tend to provide the user with a reasonably-sized dataset and some
example queries that showcase how to use Memgraph on that particular dataset. We
encourage all Memgraph users to go through at least one of the tutorials as they
can also serve as a verification that Memgraph is successfully installed on your
system.

So far we have covered the following topics with basic tutorials:

- **[Analyzing TED Talks](analyzing-ted-talks.md)** - [Try it on
  Playground!](https://playground.memgraph.com/sandbox/ted-talks)

If you are looking for more complex tutorials that include the usage of database
functionalities such as query modules, then take a look at these:

- **[Understanding music (with modules)](understanding-music-with-modules.md)**
- **[Social Network Analysis with NetworkX](social-network-analysis.md)**

## Building applications and other tutorials

These articles demonstrate how to build real-world applications that use graph
analytics and how to perform complex network analysis with Memgraph. Each one
focuses on a specific problem.
