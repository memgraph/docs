title: How to use the NetworkX library with Memgraph
sidebar_label: Utilize the NetworkX library
---

NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure,
dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Memgraph has [**`nxalg`**](/docs/mage/query-modules/python/nxalg) query module, which is a wrapper around NetworkX graph algorithms. It also provides **[Graph Analyzer](/mage/query-modules/python/graph-analyzer)** query module, which utilizes the NetworkX library. Besides that, you can create a custom query module that uses the NetworkX library. Through this how-to guide, you can find out:

- [**How to implement custom NetworkX module**](#how-to-implement-custom-networkx-module)


## How to run NetworkX algorithms in Memgraph Lab

NetworkX algorithms are integrated into Memgraph as query modules inside Memgraphâ€™s open-source graph extension library [MAGE](/docs/mage). Head over to the guide on [how to call MAGE procedures](/docs/mage/usage/calling-procedures) to find out how to call all Memgraph procedures, including those that utilize the NetworkX library.

This how-to guide will show one simple example of calling a NetworkX procedure in Memgraph's visual interface Memgraph Lab. 

### 1. Connect to Memgraph

First, run Memgraph using the Memgraph Platform Docker image, which includes both the MAGE library and Memgraph Lab. 
To run the image, open a command-line interpreter and run the following Docker command:

```
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform:latest
```

[Connect to Memgraph](/docs/memgraph-lab/connect-to-memgraph#connecting-to-memgraph) via Memgraph Lab which is running at `localhost:3000`. 

Check out the [installation guide](/docs/memgraph/installation) for other installation options. If you wish to avoid the installation, you can also use [Memgraph Cloud](/docs/memgraph-cloud/).

### 2. Load the dataset

Head over to the **Datasets** section to load a dataset and load the **Europe backpacking dataset**. 

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-1.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

### 3. Run NetworkX algorithm

Once the dataset is loaded, go to the **Query Modules** section and search for `nxalg` module. Click on the arrow next to the module name to **view module details**. 

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-2.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

The goal is to run the [`is_bipartite()`](/docs/mage/query-modules/python/nxalg#is_bipartite) procedure to check whether the graph is bipartite. 

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-3.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

Copy the query, go to the **Query Execution** tab and paste the query into the **Cypher Editor**:

```cypher 
CALL nxalg.is_bipartite() YIELD is_bipartite;
```

By clicking on the **Run Query** button, you can see that the Europe backpacking graph is not bipartite.

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-4.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

In the same way, you can run other procedures from the `nxalg` module and the procedures from the `graph_analyzer` module, which can be found in the **Query Modules** section.

## How to implement custom NetworkX module in Memgraph Lab

Besides using already implemented modules, you can create your own module which utilizes the NetworkX library.
To learn how to implement a custom query module, head over to the [example of query module in Python](/docs/memgraph/reference-guide/query-modules/implement-custom-query-modules/custom-query-module-example#python-api).

Since Memgraph is integrated with NetworkX, you can import NetworkX library inside Python code. This guide will show you how to create a new query module that utilizes the NetworkX library within Memgraph's visual interface Memgraph Lab.

### 1. Connect to Memgraph

First, run Memgraph using the Memgraph Platform Docker image, which includes both the MAGE library and Memgraph Lab. 
To run the image, open a command-line interpreter and run the following Docker command:

```
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform:latest
```

[Connect to Memgraph](/docs/memgraph-lab/connect-to-memgraph#connecting-to-memgraph) via Memgraph Lab which is running at `localhost:3000`. 

Check out the [installation guide](/docs/memgraph/installation) for other installation options. If you wish to avoid the installation, you can also use [Memgraph Cloud](/docs/memgraph-cloud/).

### 2. Load the dataset

In the **Datasets** section, find and load the Karate club friendship network dataset. 

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-5.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

### 3. Implement a custom query module

Once the dataset is loaded, go to the **Query modules** section. The goal is to create a community detection algorithm that can partition a network into multiple communities with the help of the NetworkX library. Click on the **New Module** and type in the module name, e.g., `communities`. 

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-6.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

There is a sample Python code on the next screen, inside the code editor. Select it, delete it and paste the following code:

```python
import mgp
import networkx as nx
from networkx.algorithms import community
from mgp_networkx import MemgraphDiGraph


@mgp.read_proc
def detect(
    ctx: mgp.ProcCtx
    ) -> mgp.Record(communities=mgp.List[mgp.List[mgp.Vertex]]):

    networkxGraph = nx.DiGraph(MemgraphDiGraph(ctx=ctx))
    communities_generator = community.girvan_newman(networkxGraph)

    return mgp.Record(communities=[
        list(s) for s in next(communities_generator)])
```

In the above code we are creating a read procedure which creates a NetworkX DiGraph from the MemgraphDiGraph object which takes the existing graph from the database. After that, we run the Girvan-Newman community algorithm and return its results.

Here is what the code looks like in the code editor:

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-7.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>

Click **Save & close**, and head over to the **Query Execution** tab. 

### 4. Run the custom query module

Copy and paste the following query to the **Cypher Editor**: 

```cypher
CALL communities.detect()
YIELD communities
UNWIND communities AS community
RETURN community;
```

After you click on **Run Query**, you can see the result, which consists of two lists. Each list represents one community. 

<img src={require('../data/how-to-guides/nxalg-how-to-8.png').default} className={"imgBorder"}/>
