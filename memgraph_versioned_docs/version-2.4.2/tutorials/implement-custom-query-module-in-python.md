In short, query modules allow you to expand the Cypher query module with various
procedures. Procedures can be written in Python or C languages. Our MAGE library
has various modules dealing with complex graph algorithms, but you can implement
your own procedures gathered in query modules to optimize your queries. If you
need more information about what query modules are, please read our [reference
guide on query modules](/reference-guide/query-modules/overview.md).

## Prerequisites

In order to start developing a custom query you will need:

- [Memgraph Platform](/installation/overview.mdx) or [Memgraph Cloud](http://cloud.memgraph.com)

## Data model

For this tutorial, we will use the Europe backpacking data model with the data
from The European Backpacker Index (2018). The data set contains information
about 56 cities from 36 European countries, such as what cities are close, what
countries border each other, various pricing and recommended accommodation.

![Backpacking](../data/backpacking_metagraph.png)

<details>
  <summary>A detailed explanation of the data model</summary>

Nodes:

- `Country` - country with the following properties (example of the value):
  - `id` - country's id (`5`)
  - `name` - country's name (`"Spain"`)
- `City` - city with the following properties (example of the value):
  - `name` - city's name (`"Barcelona"`)
  - `country` - country's name (`"Spain"`)
  - `cheapest_hostel` - the cheapest hostel in the city (`"Amistat Beach Hostel
    Barcelona"`)
  - `hostel_url` - URL of the cheapest hostel in the city
    (`"https://www.priceoftravel.com/ABarcelonaHostel"`)
  - `rank` - the cheapest hostel's rank according to The European Backpacker
    Index (`38`)
  - `local_currency` - the name of the local currency (`"Euro"`)
  - `local_currency_code` - ISO3 code of the local currency (`"EUR"`)
  - `total_USD` - total daily cost including accommodation, attractions,
    meals/drinks and transportation in USD (`80.104`)
  - `cost_per_night_USD` - daily cost of the cheapest hostel per night in USD
    (`23.684`)
  - `attractions_USD` - daily cost of the attractions in USD (`16.12`)
  - `meals_USD` - daily cost of the meals in USD (`23.808`)
  - `drinks_USD` - daily cost of the drinks in USD (`11.16`)
  - `transportation_USD` - daily cost of the transportation in USD (`5.332`)

Relationships:

- `:Inside` - connects `City` node to the `Country` node if the city is within
  the country
- `:CloseTo` - connects two `City` nodes if cities are from the same or
  neighboring countries
  - `eu_border` - relationship property that indicates whether the EU border
    needs to be crossed to reach the other city (`true`)
- `:Borders` - connects two `Country` nodes if they are neighboring countries.
  - `eu_border` - relationship property that indicates whether the EU border
    needs to be crossed to reach the other country (`true`)

</details>

In this tutorial, we will mostly focus on the two nodes, `:City` and `:Country`,
and their `:Inside` relationship.

## Preparing Memgraph

Let's open Memgraph Lab where we will import the dataset, as well as write and
use the procedures from our query module.

If you have successfully installed Memgraph Platform, you should be able to open
Memgraph Lab in a browser at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

If you are using Memgraph Cloud, open the running instance, and open the
**Connect via Client** tab, then click on **Connect in Browser** to open
Memgraph Lab in a new browser tab. Enter your project password and **Connect Now**. 

In Memgraph Lab, navigate to the **Datasets** menu item, click on the **Europe
backpacking** dataset to import it into Memgraph. You can also check the details
of the dataset by clicking on **Quick View**

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/import-dataset.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

Go to the **Query Execution** and try running a test query that will show
the city Vienna and all its relationships:

```Cypher
MATCH p=(:City {name: "Vienna"})-[]-()
RETURN (p);
```

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/vienna.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

You can click on the `:City` nodes to check the nodes' properties and get better
acquainted with the dataset. We will come back to this view every time we want
to test our query modules in making.

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/vienna-details.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

Now navigate to **Query Modules**. Here you can see all the query modules
available in Memgraph, such as utility modules or query modules from the MAGE
library. To create a new custom query module, click on the **New Module**
button, give the new module name `backpacking` and create the module. Memgraph
Lab creates sample procedures to kick off your development. But before we start,
let's decide how we will expand the query language.

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/new-module.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

## Goals

Before we start to write a query module and procedures within, we need goals.
How do we want to expand the query language?

**Goal 1:** We want to get a total cost of accommodation expenses for one night
at the cheapest hostel in a given city, based on the number of adults and
children that will be staying in it.

**Goal 2:** We also want to expand the data model by a given country and city.
The new `City` node should get properties that it shares with the other cities
in that country, such as `country`, `local_currency` and `local_currency_code`.

## Python API

Python API is defined in the `mgp` module you can find in the Memgraph
installation directory `/usr/lib/memgraph/python_support`. If you are using
Docker, you can copy the file from the Docker container into your computer for
faster access.

<details>
  <summary>Copy the <code>mgp</code> module from a Docker container</summary>

**1.** If it's not running, start your Memgraph instance using Docker.

**2.** Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER ID` of the Memgraph Docker
container:

```
docker ps
```

**3.** Position yourself in the local directory where you want to copy the file.

**4.** Copy a file from the container to your current directory with the
following command:

```
docker cp <CONTAINER ID>:/usr/lib/memgraph/python_support/mgp.py mgp.py
```

Be sure to enter the correct CONTAINER ID.

Example of a command when copying the `mgp.py` file to the user's desktop:

```
C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp 63e35:/usr/lib/memgraph/python_support/mgp.py mgp.py
```

</details>

In essence, Python API is a wrapper around the C API. If you look at row 15 of
the new module we've created in Memgraph Lab, you can see you need to import the
`mgp` module at the beginning of every query module.

Below the `import mgp`, in line 17, you can see a `@read_proc` decorator. Python
API defines `@mgp.read_proc`, `@mgp.write_proc` and `@mgp.transformation`
decorators. `@mgp.read_proc` decorator handles read-only procedures, the
`@mgp.write_proc` decorator handles procedures that also write to the database,
and the `@mgp.transformation` decorator handles data coming from streams.

If you look at our two goals, to get the total cost of accommodation, Memgraph
only needs to read from the database to get the value of the
`cost_per_night_USD`, while to create new nodes it also needs to write in the
database.

Feel free to examine the examples and tips available in this template, and when
you are ready to continue with the tutorial, clear the file so we start writing
our code from line 1.

We'll start with the `@mgp.read_proc` decorator to achieve the first goal, then
we'll dive into a bit more complicated second goal and its `@mgp.write_proc`.

## Read procedure

As we established in the previous chapter, first we need to import the `mgp`
module and then use the `@mgp.read_proc` decorator. Then we will define the
procedure by giving it a name and signature, that is, what arguments it needs to
receive and what values it will return.

The goal of this procedure is to get a total cost of accommodation expenses for
one night at the cheapest hostel in a given city, based on the number of adults
and children that will be staying in it.

So, let's name the procedure `total_cost`. The procedure needs to receive the
following arguments in order to calculate the total cost of accommodation:

- the whole graph (all the nodes and relationships)
- the name of the city we are interested in
- the number of adults staying at the accommodation
- the number of children.

The graph is passed to the procedure using the `ProcCtx` instance. The name of
the city should be a string value, the number of adults an integer, and the
number of children also an integer. Because customers can travel with or without
children, we will define the children variable as optional by giving it a
possibility to be `NULL` and setting it to a default value of `None`.

Output values are defined as arguments of the `Record` class. We want the
function to return the total cost per night as a float value, and we'll enable
the value to be NULL so that the procedure doesn't return an error if the city
doesn't have the cost of accommodation as a property and thus can't calculate
the total cost of accommodation.

After defining the name and signature, the code should look like this:

```python
import mgp

@mgp.read_proc
def total_cost(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
               city: str,
               adults: int,
               children: mgp.Nullable[int] = None
               ) -> mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = mgp.Nullable[float]):
```

Now we want to go through all the nodes (vertices) in our graph and find only
those nodes that have both:

1.  the property `name` with the same value as the variable `city`
2.  the property `cost_pre_night_USD` with a float value.

```python
import mgp

@mgp.read_proc
def total_cost(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
              city: str,
              adults: int,
              children: mgp.Nullable[int] = None
              ) -> mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = mgp.Nullable[float]):

  for vertex in context.graph.vertices:
    if vertex.properties["name"] == city and isinstance(vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD"),float):
```

When we find those nodes, we will save the cost of accommodation per night in a
variable `cost_per_night` and multiply it with the number of adults to get the
`total_cost`.

```python
import mgp

@mgp.read_proc
def total_cost(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
               city: str,
               adults: int,
               children: mgp.Nullable[int] = None
               ) -> mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = mgp.Nullable[float]):

  for vertex in context.graph.vertices:
    if vertex.properties["name"] == city and isinstance(vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD"),float):
      cost_per_night = vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD")
      total_cost = cost_per_night * adults
```

Then we need to check if the number of children was given as an argument when
calling the procedure in query, and if it was, add half the cost of
accommodation for each child. At the end, we return the total cost of
accommodation per night.

```python
import mgp

@mgp.read_proc
def total_cost(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
               city: str,
               adults: int,
               children: mgp.Nullable[int] = None
               ) -> mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = mgp.Nullable[float]):

  for vertex in context.graph.vertices:
    if vertex.properties["name"] == city and isinstance(vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD"),float):
      cost_per_night = vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD")
      total_cost = cost_per_night * adults
      if children is not None:
        total_cost += cost_per_night / 2 * children
      return mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = total_cost)
```

If none of the nodes have both the property `name` with the same value as the
variable `city` nor the property `cost_pre_night_USD` with a float value, we
will set the value of `Total_cost_per_night` to `None` (that is, `NULL`) in
order to prevent the procedure from generating an error.

The finished procedure now looks like this:

```python
import mgp

@mgp.read_proc
def total_cost(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
              city: str,
              adults: int,
              children: mgp.Nullable[int] = None
              ) -> mgp.Record(
                              Total_cost_per_night = mgp.Nullable[float]):

  for vertex in context.graph.vertices:
    if vertex.properties["name"] == city and isinstance(vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD"),float):
      cost_per_night = vertex.properties.get("cost_per_night_USD")
      total_cost = cost_per_night * adults
      if children is not None:
        total_cost += cost_per_night / 2 * children
      return mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = total_cost)

  return mgp.Record(Total_cost_per_night = None)
```

Save and close the query module. You will get an overview of the module that
lists procedures and their signature.

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/module-details.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

### Testing the read procedure

Switch to **Query Execution** and call the procedure using the clause `CALL`,
then calling the right module and procedure within it
(`backpacking.total_cost`). List all arguments except the whole graph inside
brackets, and at the end YIELD all the results:

```cypher
CALL backpacking.total_cost("Zagreb", 2, 3) YIELD *;
```

Result -> `Total_cost_per_night = 32.129999999999995`

```cypher
CALL backpacking.total_cost("Vienna", 2) YIELD *;
```

Result -> `Total_cost_per_night = 45.012`

```cypher
CALL backpacking.total_cost("Whatever", 2) YIELD *;
```

Result -> `Total_cost_per_night = null`

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/total-cost.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

## Detecting errors

Some errors will be written out as you are trying to call the procedure. Others
can be viewed in the log file.

If you started your Memgraph Platform image by exposing the `7444` port, you can
check the logs from Memgraph Lab. Otherwise, you need to [access the logs in the
Docker container](../how-to-guides/config-logs.md#accessing-logs).

But the rest of the errors in the code will result in the procedure not being
detected. That means that if you go to the **Query Modules** menu item and check
module details by clicking on the arrow on the right, the procedure with an
error will not be listed.

## Write procedure

You can continue writing the write procedure below the read procedure. To edit
the current module go to **Query Modules** and find the `backpacking` module.
Click on the arrow to view details about the module, such as the name of the
procedures and their signatures. To continue editing the module, click on **Edit
code**. If you are writing the write procedure in a new module, don't forget to
import the `mgp` module. For the write procedure, we will use the `@mgp.write_proc`
decorator.

The goal of this write procedure is to expand the data model by a given country
and city. The new `City` node should get properties that it shares with the
other cities in that country, such as `country`, `local_currency` and
`local_currency_code`.

Let's name the procedure `new_city`. The procedure needs to receive the
following arguments in order to create two new nodes and connect them:

- the whole graph (all the nodes and relationships)
- the name of the city
- the name of the country.

The graph is passed to the procedure using the `ProcCtx` instance. The names of
the city and country should be of string values.

Output values are defined as arguments of the `Record` class. We want the
function to return the city and country nodes and their relationship.

After defining the name and signature, the code should look like this:

```python
@mgp.write_proc
def new_city(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
             in_city: mgp.Nullable[str],
             in_country: mgp.Nullable[str]
                    ) -> mgp.Record(City = mgp.Vertex,
                                    Relationship = mgp.Edge,
                                    Country = mgp.Vertex):
```

We will gradually expand our code to cover all three cases:

1. the city and country nodes already exist
2. the country node exists but the city node doesn't
3. neither the country node nor the city node exist

### The city and country nodes already exist

We want to check if the city and country passed as arguments already exist in
the database because if they do, there is no need to create them. We can just
return them as a result. Because the `City` nodes also include the `country`
property, we can only check `City` nodes to find out if a certain city inside a
certain country already exists.

So let's go through all the nodes (vertices) in the graph to check if there is a
node with the `country` property of the same value as the `in_country` argument.
If there is, let's check if the `name` property of that nodes is of the same
value as the as the `in_city` argument. If there is, it means there are already
`City` and `Country` nodes with the same `name` properties as the `in_city` and
`in_country` arguments.

To return the relationship between them, we need to go through all the
relationships from the `City` node and find the one with type `Inside`. Then we
will save the destination node in the `country` variable, and return both nodes
and the relationship.

```python
@mgp.write_proc
def new_city(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
             in_city: mgp.Nullable[str],
             in_country: mgp.Nullable[str]
                    ) -> mgp.Record(City = mgp.Vertex,
                                    Relationship = mgp.Edge,
                                    Country = mgp.Vertex):

    for v in context.graph.vertices:
      if v.properties.get("country") == in_country:
              if v.properties.get("name") == in_city:
                  for r in v.out_edges:
                      if r.type == "Inside":
                          country = r.to_vertex
                          return mgp.Record(City=v, Relationship=r, Country=country)
```

At this point you can save the module and test the new procedure, by running the
following query:

```cypher
CALL backpacking.new_city("Zagreb","Croatia") YIELD *;
```

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/existing.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

### The country node exists but the city node doesn't

In the case that the `Country` node with that name exists, but the `City` node
doesn't, we should create a new `City` node, and connect it with the existing
`Country` node. Because the `City` nodes have properties about the country they
are connected to, we will use the existing `City` nodes to copy property values
to the new `City` node, such as `local_currency` and `local_currency_code`.

The new `City` node also has to get a new `id` number, that's why we will save
the highest existing `id` among `City` nodes in the `city_id` and increase that
number by 1 to get the ID of the new `City` node. Now that we have created a new
`City` node, we need to create a relationship to connect it with the existing
`Country` node and return both nodes and the relationship.

```python
@mgp.write_proc
def new_city(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
             in_city: mgp.Nullable[str],
             in_country: mgp.Nullable[str]
                    ) -> mgp.Record(City = mgp.Vertex,
                                    Relationship = mgp.Edge,
                                    Country = mgp.Vertex):

    city_id = 0
    currency = None
    currency_code = None

    for v in context.graph.vertices:
      label, = v.labels # get node label
      if (label == "City") and (v.properties.get("id") > city_id): # the following 2 lines are getting the highest ID
          city_id = v.properties.get("id")
      if v.properties.get("country") == in_country:
              currency = v.properties.get("local_currency") # the following 2 lines are saving property values
              currency_code = v.properties.get("local_currency_code")
              if v.properties.get("name") == in_city:
                  for r in v.out_edges:
                      if r.type == "Inside":
                          country = r.to_vertex
                          return mgp.Record(City=v, Relationship=r, Country=country)

    city = context.graph.create_vertex() # creating a new node with properties
    city.add_label("City")
    city.properties.set("id", city_id + 1)
    city.properties.set("name", in_city)
    city.properties.set("country", in_country)
    city.properties.set("local_currency", currency)
    city.properties.set("local_currency_code", currency_code)

    for v in context.graph.vertices: # creating a new relationship to an existing country
            if v.properties.get("name") == in_country:
                context.graph.create_edge(city, v, mgp.EdgeType("Inside"))
                for r in city.out_edges:
                    if r.type == "Inside":
                        return mgp.Record(City=city, Relationship=r, Country=v)
```

At this point you can save the module and test the new additions to the
procedure, by running the following query:

```cypher
CALL backpacking.new_city("Makarska","Croatia") YIELD *;
```

<img src={require('../data/tutorials/query-modules/no-city.png').default}
className={"imgBorder"}/>

### Neither the country node nor the city node exist

Lastly, in the case there is no `City` node nor `Country` node with the `name`
properties the same as the provided arguments, we need to create both.

That is why we also need to find the largest ID among the `Country` nodes.
Because we only need to create a new `Country` node if one doesn't exist, we
will introduce a `country_exists` variable with a default value `False`. The
value of that flag will change to `True` only if both the Country node with the
`name` property the same as the `in_country` argument exists.

This is also the finished procedure:

```python
@mgp.write_proc
def new_city(context: mgp.ProcCtx,
             in_city: mgp.Nullable[str],
             in_country: mgp.Nullable[str]
                    ) -> mgp.Record(City = mgp.Vertex,
                                    Relationship = mgp.Edge,
                                    Country = mgp.Vertex):

    in_country_exists = False
    country_id = 0
    city_id = 0
    currency = None
    currency_code = None

    for v in context.graph.vertices:
      label, = v.labels # get node label
      if (label == "City") and (v.properties.get("id") > city_id): # the following 4 lines are getting the highest IDs
          city_id = v.properties.get("id")
      if (label == "Country") and (v.properties.get("id") > country_id):
          country_id = v.properties.get("id")
      if v.properties.get("country") == in_country:
              country_exists = True # flag is changed to `True`
              currency = v.properties.get("local_currency")
              currency_code = v.properties.get("local_currency_code")
              if v.properties.get("name") == in_city:
                  for r in v.out_edges:
                      if r.type == "Inside":
                          country = r.to_vertex
                          return mgp.Record(City=v, Relationship=r, Country=country)

    city = context.graph.create_vertex() # creating a new node with properties
    city.add_label("City")

### Testing the write procedure

Save the query module, switch to **Query Execution** and call the procedure
using the clause `CALL`, then calling the right module and procedure within it
(`backpacking.new_city`). List all arguments except the whole graph inside
brackets, and at the end `YIELD` all the results:

```cypher
CALL backpacking.new_city("Zagreb", "Croatia") YIELD *;
```

The query returns existing `City` and `Country` nodes.

```cypher
CALL backpacking.new_city("Vinkovci", "Croatia") YIELD *;
```

The query returns new `City` node connected to an existing `Country` node.

```cypher
CALL backpacking.new_city("Vinkovci", "Makroland") YIELD *;
```

The query returns a new `City` node connected to a new `Country` node.

## Where to next?
