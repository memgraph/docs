This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run
**MemgraphDB** on Linux with Docker. 

:::caution

Newer versions of Memgraph are currently **not backward compatible** with older
versions. That is why you won't be able to load storage snapshots between
different versions.

:::

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you proceed with the installation guide, make sure that you have:

- **Docker Desktop** - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in
order to install MemgraphDB.

:::info

Memgraph's Docker image was built with **Docker version `1.12`** and should be
compatible with all newer versions.

:::

## Install MemgraphDB {#base-installation-guide}

**1.** Download the latest **Memgraph Docker image** from the [Download
Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/).

**2.** Import the image using the following command:

```console
docker load -i /path-to/memgraph-<version>-docker.tar.gz
```

## Start MemgraphDB {#starting-memgraph}

To start Memgraph, use the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph/memgraph
```

If successful, you should see a message similar to the following:

```console
You are running Memgraph vX.X.X
To get started with Memgraph, visit https://memgr.ph/start
```

At this point, the Memgraph database is ready for you to [submit Cypher
queries](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx) via a command-line tool **mgconsole**,
visual user interface **Memgraph Lab** or various **drivers**.

:::info

The username and password for connecting to the database are empty by default.

:::

## Stop MemgraphDB {#stopping-memgraph}

To stop a Memgraph database instance, run the following command:

```console
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
```

You can find the name of the container (`CONTAINER_NAME`) by running:

```console
docker ps
```

## Configuration file and logs {#base-configuration}

If you need to access the Memgraph configuration file or logs, you will need to
specify the following volumes when starting Memgraph:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 \
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph \
  -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph \
  -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph \
  memgraph/memgraph --log-level=TRACE
```

The configuration file is located in the `mg_etc` volume. The exact location of
the file depends on your specific setup, but usually it is
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf`. 

The logs will be saved to the `mg_log` volume, and directories can usually be found in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

When using Docker, you can also specify the configuration options in the `docker
run` command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --log-level=TRACE
```

:::caution

When working with MemgraphDB, you should pass configuration flags as arguments.

For example, you should start the MemgraphDB image with `docker run
memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE`, and Memgraph Platform
with `docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -p 7444:7444-e
MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform`.

guide](/reference-guide/configuration.md).
