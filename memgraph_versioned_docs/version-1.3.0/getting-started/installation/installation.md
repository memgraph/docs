This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run Memgraph.

Memgraph is available to [download as a binary](https://memgraph.com/download/) in the following formats:
  * **[Docker (Windows, Linux, macOS)](./docker-installation.md)**
  * **[Debian package](./debian-installation.md)**
  * **[RPM package](./rpm-installation.md)**

We recommend using Docker because it simplifies the installation process and offers a lot of flexibility to new users.

:::info
Newer versions of Memgraph are currently not backward compatible with older versions. This is mainly noticeable by being unable to load storage snapshots between different versions.
