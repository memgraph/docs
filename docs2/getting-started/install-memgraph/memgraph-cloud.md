[Memgraph Cloud](https://memgraph.com/cloud) is a cloud service fully managed
on AWS and available in 6 geographic regions around the world. Memgraph Cloud
allows you to create projects with Enterprise instances of MemgraphDB from your
browser. The instances can use up to 32 GB of RAM and you can connect to them
using [Memgraph Lab](cloud-connect#connect-with-memgraph-lab),
[mgconsole](cloud-connect#connect-with-mgconsole) or various
[drivers](cloud-connect#connect-with-drivers). All connections use SSL
encryption with a self-signed certificate. 


![Cloud-Img](../data/memgraph-cloud/cloud-img.svg)


Use Memgraph Cloud to stream data into Memgraph in real-time and run complex
graph algorithms and modules developed within the [MAGE](/docs/mage) repository,
such as
[PageRank](/docs/mage/algorithms/traditional-graph-analytics/pagerank-algorithm),
[Community
detection](/docs/mage/algorithms/traditional-graph-analytics/community-detection-algorithm)
or [Betweenness
centrality](/docs/mage/algorithms/traditional-graph-analytics/betweenness-centrality-algorithm).
You can also extend the Cypher query language by developing your own procedures
within query modules in Memgraph Lab.

Instances can be easily paused to save resources, backed up and cloned by
creating snapshots, and they all use the Enterprise edition of Memgraph which
includes the [role-base access control](cloud-projects/#role-base-access-control).

As a new user, try out Memgraph Cloud in a 14-days free trial and provide us

You can also register to Memgraph Cloud with your Google account. 

:::


As a new user, you will start using a 14-day free trial version of Memgraph
Cloud, in which you can create one project that uses up to 2GB RAM. 

If you require more compute, enter a valid payment method and upgrade your
project.

Below is a demo video made for the launch that will take you through setting up
the Cloud account: 

[<img alt="cloud-singup" src={require('../data/memgraph-cloud/cloud-login.png').default} style={{width:'30%'}}/>](https://youtu.be/Tt5KPKylU8k?t=683 "How to create Cloud account")

the Projects section of Memgraph Cloud where you manage projects: 

[<img alt="project-management" src={require('../data/memgraph-cloud/project-management.png').default} style={{width:'30%'}}/>](https://youtu.be/Tt5KPKylU8k?t=1029 "Projects section")

### Back up a project

A project is backed up by creating a snapshot with Amazon EBS. You cannot create
a snapshot if you are using a 14-day free trial version of Memgraph Cloud.

If you are using a paid version of Memgraph Cloud, you can create a maximum of 5
snapshots with the following [rates](payment). If you need more snapshots, feel
free to [contact us](/help-center). 

The size of the snapshot is 8 GB smaller than the disk size the project is
using. If you are using 1 GB of RAM and 11 GB of disk, the snapshot size is 3GB. 

To create a snapshot:
1. Click **Projects** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the project you want to back up.
3. In the **Actions** section, click **Create Snapshot**.
4. In the pop-up, give the snapshot a name and **Create** it.

You can manage your snapshots in the **Snapshots** view, where you can **Edit
Name** or **Delete Snapshot**.

## Restore or clone a project

You can restore or clone projects from the snapshots you've created from
existing projects.

To restore or clone a project:
1. Click **Snapshots** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the snapshot you want to use.
3. In the **Actions** section, click **Reboot as Project**.
4. In the pop-up, give the new project a name, set password and select project
   size, then **RESTORE**.
   
### Resize a project

When your project becomes to big for the current compute, upgrade it:

1. [Back up the project](#back-up-a-project) by creating a snapshot.
2. [Clone the project](#restore-or-clone-a-project) to a bigger project.
3. [Delete the smaller project.](#pause-resume-or-delete-a-project)

If you feel your project is too small for the current compute, downgrade it:
1. Export the database (using Memgraph Lab, mgconsole, GQLAlchemy, driver or any
other tool).
2. [Create a new Memgraph Cloud project](#create-a-new-memgraph-cloud-project).
3. Use an appropriate tool to connect to the project and import the database.

### Role-base access control

Memgraph Cloud project instances come with 3 roles: `admin`, `readonly`,
`readwrite`

Users can belong to one of these three roles and the admin can grant, deny or
revoke a certain set of privileges, thereby eliminating security concerns.
Read more [how to manage user
privileges](/docs/memgraph/how-to-guides/manage-user-privileges).

## Connect to Cloud instances

ou can connect to an instance running within the Memgraph Cloud project via
**Memgraph Lab**, a visual interface, **mgconsole**, command-line interface, or
one of many **drivers** below. 

Fell free to watch a demo video made for the Cloud launch that will explain
how to connect to Memgraph using Memgraph Cloud:

```
rsmgclient = "2.0.0"
```
Step 3: Copy the following code and fill out the missing details (`YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD`, `YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME` and `MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS`) before running it:

```rust
use rsmgclient::{ConnectParams, Connection, MgError, Value, SSLMode};

fn execute_query() -> Result<(), MgError> {
    // Connect to Memgraph.
    let connect_params = ConnectParams {
        host: Some(String::from("MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS")),
        port: 7687,
        username: Some(String::from("YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME")),
        password: Some(String::from("YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD")),
        sslmode: SSLMode::Require,
        ..Default::default()
    };
    let mut connection = Connection::connect(&connect_params)?;

    // Create simple graph.
    connection.execute_without_results(
        "CREATE (p1:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[l1:Likes]->(m:Software {name: 'Memgraph'}) \
         CREATE (p2:Person {name: 'John'})-[l2:Likes]->(m);",
    )?;

    // Fetch the graph.
    let columns = connection.execute("MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN n, r, m;", None)?;
    println!("Columns: {}", columns.join(", "));
    for record in connection.fetchall()? {
        for value in record.values {
            match value {
                Value::Node(node) => print!("{}", node),
                Value::Relationship(edge) => print!("-{}-", edge),
                value => print!("{}", value),
            }
        }
        println!();
    }
    connection.commit()?;

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    if let Err(error) = execute_query() {
        panic!("{}", error)
    }
}
```

Step 2: Copy the following code and fill out the missing details (`YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD`, `YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME` and `MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS`) before running it:

```c
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

#include <mgclient.hpp>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  mg::Client::Init();

  mg::Client::Params params;
  params.host = "MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS";
  params.port = "7687";
  params.username = "YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME";
  params.password = "YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD";
  params.use_ssl = true;
  auto client = mg::Client::Connect(params);

  if (!client) {
    std::cerr << "Failed to connect!\n";
    return 1;
  }

  if (!client->Execute("CREATE (n:FirstNode {message: 'Hello Memgraph from C++!'}) RETURN n")) {
    std::cerr << "Failed to execute query!\n";
    return 1;
  }

  while (const auto maybe_result = client->FetchOne()) {
    const auto result = *maybe_result;
    if (result.size() < 1) {
      continue;
    }
    const auto value = result[0];
    if (value.type() != mg::Value::Type::Node) {
      continue;
    }
    const auto node = value.ValueNode();
    const auto props = node.properties();
    std::cout << "Created node: " << props["message"].ValueString() << std::endl;
  }

  // Deallocate the client because mg_finalize has to be called globally.
  client.reset(nullptr);

  mg::Client::Finalize();

  return 0;
}
```

#### PHP

Step 1: Install the driver with composer:

```
composer require stefanak-michal/memgraph-bolt-wrapper
```

Step 2: Copy the following code and fill out the missing details (`YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD`, `YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME` and `MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS`) before running it:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Create a connection class and specify target host and port.
$conn = new \\Bolt\\connection\\StreamSocket('MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS', '7687');
$conn->setSslContextOptions([
    'peer_name' => 'Memgraph DB',
    'allow_self_signed' => true
]);

// Create a new Bolt instance and provide a connection object.
$bolt = new \\Bolt\\Bolt($conn);

// Set available Bolt versions for Memgraph.
$bolt->setProtocolVersions(4.1, 4, 3);

// Build and get protocol version instance which creates connection and executes a handshake.
$protocol = $bolt->build();

// Login to database with credentials
$protocol->hello(\\Bolt\\helpers\\Auth::basic('YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME', 'YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD'));

// Pipeline two messages. One to execute query with parameters and second to pull records.
$protocol
    ->run('CREATE (a:Greeting) SET a.message = $message RETURN id(a) AS nodeId, a.message AS message', ['message' => 'Hello, World!'])
    ->pull();

// Server responses are waiting to be fetched through iterator.
$rows = iterator_to_array($protocol->getResponses(), false);

// Get content from requested record.
$row = $rows[1]->getContent();
echo 'Node ' . $row[0] . ' says: ' . $row[1];
```

#### node.js

Step 1: Install the driver with npm:

```
npm install neo4j-driver
```

Step 2: Copy the following code and fill out the missing details( `YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD`, `YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME` and `MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS` ) before running it:

```php
const neo4j = require('neo4j-driver')

const MEMGRAPH_URI = 'bolt+ssc://MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS:7687';
const MEMGRAPH_USERNAME = 'YOUR_MEMGRAPH_USERNAME';
// Place your Memgraph password that was created during Project creation
const MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD = 'YOUR_MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD';

const helloMemgraph = async (uri, username, password) => {
    const driver = neo4j.driver(uri, neo4j.auth.basic(username, password));

    const session = driver.session();
    const message = 'Hello Memgraph from Node.js!';

    try {
        const result = await session.run(
            `CREATE (n:FirstNode {message: $message}) RETURN n`,
            { message },
        );

        const singleRecord = result.records[0];
        const node = singleRecord.get(0);

        console.log('Created node:', node.properties.message);
    } finally {
        await session.close()

## Payment

Below are instructions on how to manage Memgraph Cloud payment, and current
Cloud rates. 

Fell free to watch a demo video made for the Cloud launch that will explain
the Account section of Memgraph Cloud where you handle your payment methods: 

[<img alt="account-payment" src={require('../data/memgraph-cloud/account-payment.png').default} style={{width:'30%'}}/>](https://youtu.be/Tt5KPKylU8k?t=941 "Account section")

### Add a payment method

To add a payment method:

1. Go to **Account** and expand the **Add Credit Card** section
2. Enter *Cardholder Name* and credit card details and **Add Card**
3. Verify the credit card

You can replace the current credit card with a new credit card by following the
same steps, and the **Remove** button will remove the credit card completely. 

### Redeem coupon code

To redeem a coupon code you first need to [add a payment
method](#add-a-payment-method), then:

1. Go to **Account** and expand the **Add Coupon Code** section
2. Enter the coupon code and **Redeem code**

Each code has an expiration date. If you do not create a project or snapshot within
that period, the code will expire. 

Once you redeem a code, it will be applied to your next invoice, regardless of
the amount of fees on the invoice, which means that the whole coupon will
applied even if the value of the coupon is higher than the amount of the invoice
it is applied to. 

### Check paid and due invoices

To check pay and due invoices:

1. Go to **Account** and open the **Invoices** tab
2. Check an estimate for the next payment or the amount of paid invoices 

You can also download paid invoices as PDF to check the cost breakdown.

### Charge rates

Below are daily and monthly project and snapshot rates within the Memgraph
Cloud.

Fell free to watch a demo video made for the Cloud launch that will explain
the logic behind payment rates: 

[<img alt="paused-project" src={require('../data/memgraph-cloud/paused-project.png').default} style={{width:'30%'}}/>](https://youtu.be/Tt5KPKylU8k?t=1070 "How are rates applied")

#### Project rates

Once your 2-week free trial is finished, the cost of the project will be
calculated by the following rates:

#### Snapshot rates

The size of a snapshot is 8 GB smaller than the disk size the project is using.
If you are using 1 GB of RAM and 11 GB of disk, the snapshot size is 3GB.
Snapshots will be charged by the following rates:

| AWS region                       | Source project size |Disk (GB) | Daily price ($) | Monthly price ($) |
