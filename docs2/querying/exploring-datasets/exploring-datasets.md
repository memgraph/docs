title: Exploring datasets with graph analytics
---

The tutorials that focus on exploring datasets want to showcase how to use
Memgraph on that particular dataset using Cypher queries. We encourage all
Memgraph users to go through at least one of the tutorials to get familiar with
Memgraph.

You can explore the datasets in two ways. If you just want to take a better look
at the data and the data model, and try out a few queries, open [Memgraph
Playground](https://playground.memgraph.com/sandboxes/) and continue with the
tutorials there. Note that you will not be able to execute `write` operations.

On the other hand, if you would like to add changes to the dataset, download the
[Memgraph Platform](https://memgraph.com/download#memgraph-platform). Once you
have it up and running, open Memgraph Lab web application within the browser on
[`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and navigate to the `Datasets` in the
sidebar. From there, choose the dataset that seems interesting to you and
continue with the tutorial. 

You can also run an instance in [Memgraph
Cloud](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-cloud/). Once you [sing
up](https://cloud.memgraph.com/), create a new project. From the project you can
connect to Memgraph Lab web application and navigate to the `Datasets` in the
sidebar to choose the preferred dataset.
