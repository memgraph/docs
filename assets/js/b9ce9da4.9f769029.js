We decided to tackle this\nproblem by writing a wrapper object for Memgraph's graph and with smarter usage\nof NetworkX algorithms. To make things even more convenient, we decided to\nimplement procedures that call NetworkX functions with our graphs, so you have\nout-of-the-box access to the graph algorithms. NetworkX contains a huge amount\nof functions, and writing procedures for all of them require insane effort, so\ndon't blame us if some of the algorithms aren't available.
