Graph databases come as a\nperfect solution to that problem since each employee can be represented with\nnode, and based on their role property, they could have access (be connected\nwith) certain data. Another way to approach access control is data-centric\naccess control. Each data has a type, and different users can access data based\non the type of data they have permission to access. The third way is\ncontext-centric access control, where everything depends on the nature of\naccess. For example, permissions are given based on the time of access and the\namount of data that an employee is trying to fetch.
