## v2.4.0 - Dec 2, 2022

## What's New

* Memgraph Lab now supports manual transaction workflows you can construct using transaction commands `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
* Cypher intellisense has been updated to suggest new Cypher features from Memgraph 2.4.0 such as:
  * Privileges for user-role authorization.
  * Commands and privileges for label-based authorization.
  * Manual transaction commands: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
  * Checking configuration with `SHOW CONFIG`.
  * All shortest path algorithm `allShortest`.
  * Graph projection function `project`.
  * Additional query module signature that accepts a projected graph as an optional first argument.
* Graph results view will check for nodes and relationships in arrays and projected graphs. It simplifies
  the visualization of a projected graph or an array of nodes/relationships without using `UNWIND`.

## Bug Fixes

* Once the table results view is selected, the results of the following query run will also preview in the table results view, instead of automatically switching to the graph view.
* Exploring a dataset's query collection now works as expected. It opens up a list of queries that can be used to explore the dataset.
* Failed queries from the rich collections now return a detailed error message.
* _Save code changes_ button in rich collections will now be enabled only if there are unsaved changes for the Cypher query 
  or GSS.
* A bug that would only show the first node label instead of all node labels in the table results view has been fixed.

## v2.3.1 - Nov 4, 2022

### Bug Fixes

* Writing a single-line comment in the Cypher code no longer results in an error.
* Having different map tiles (e.g. "light" map tile on one map view, but "dark" map tile on another map view) for multiple graph map views in the rich collection is enabled and works as expected.
* Graph rendering freeze when toggling the map view on/off during the graph rendering process has been fixed.
* All the information about nodes and edges on the graph schema is now previewed as expected.
* A bug that would mix query title and description when queries are reordered in the rich query collection has been fixed.
* A bug that would not reset the description field when adding a new query to the query collection has been fixed.
* Saving a new style now works as expected. The active style is saved, not the last applied one.

## v2.3.0 - Oct 24, 2022

### What's New

* Add new updates to the prepared datasets:
  * Add a search bar for searching and filtering datasets.
  * Add featured (highlighted) datasets.
  * Add rich collections with prepared queries, descriptions, and GSS for each dataset.
* Add new updates to the latest queries:
  * Change the name from "Latest queries" to "Run history" because it contains both queries and GSS changes.
  * Show GSS changes in the "Run history" section.
* Replace previous collections with "Rich collections":
  * Add more context to each collected query: title, markdown description, Cypher query, and GSS.
  * Add the ability to run multiple query executions within the query collection.
  * Add import and export functionality of a collection.
* Add a new version of GSS:
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle` to configure physics, link distance, repel force, and view type (`default` or `map`).
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle.Map` to configure map tiles for map view.
  * Add new GSS functions: `Slice`, `Split`, `Replace`, `Trim`, `Nodes`, `Edges`, `IsNumber`, `IsBoolean`, `IsString`, `IsNull`.
  * Add new GSS node properties `latitude` and `longitude` used to define the latitude and longitude of each node for the map view.
* Integrate graph visualization library `orb`.
* Add the ability to enable/disable map background view for nodes with geo information.
* Add the ability to connect to Neo4j, load datasets, and run Cypher queries.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix map view to use latitude and longitude from GSS style instead of `lat` and `lng` node properties.
* Fix the default GSS to match new the map view configuration by checking `lat` and `lng` node properties.
