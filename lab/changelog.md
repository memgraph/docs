## Lab v2.7.1 - Jul 05, 2023

### Bug fixes

- Bug that would allow multiple styles to be the default has been fixed. 
- The System Default Style now has `background-color` set to white.
- Queries selected in the Query Editor now execute as expected. 
- Creating and editing a query module as well as selecting a transformation
  module in the Streams section now work as expected. 
- All links are now linked with appropriate external resources. 

## Lab v2.7.0 - Jun 28, 2023

### What's new

- Now you can adjust the following settings:
  - Code completion and automatic graph rendering limits
  - The capacity of run history and its clearing
  - The limit for visible logs

  <img src={require('./data/lab-270/settings.png').default} className={"imgBorder"} style={{marginBottom:'20px'}}/>
- The new interfaces for managing saved styles enables searching and changing
  the default style in the Lab. The saved styles now also have a preview. 
  <img src={require('./data/lab-270/styles.png').default} className={"imgBorder"} style={{marginBottom:'20px'}}/>
- The run history now also tracks changes to the query, style, or both. You can
  also filter out records to show All (both queries runs and applied styles),
  Query history (only query runs), and Style history (only applied style
  changes). You can expand both the query and style to see the full Cypher or
  GSS code.
  <img src={require('./data/lab-270/run_history.png').default} className={"imgBorder"} style={{marginBottom:'20px'}}/>
  <img src={require('./data/lab-270/run_history_expand.png').default} className={"imgBorder"} style={{marginBottom:'20px'}}/>
  <img src={require('./data/lab-270/run_history_queries.png').default} className={"imgBorder"} style={{marginBottom:'20px'}}/>
- Queries inside a collection can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on their
  name.
- When testing and trying out different functions in the GSS you can use
  single-line (`// comment`) and multi-line (`/* comment */`) comments in the
  GSS code editor without losing previous state.
- Change the canvas color of the graph view with the new property
  `background-color` in [`@ViewStyle`](/style-script/gss-viewstyle-directive.md).
- Change the stack order of how nodes and edges are rendered in the graph view
  with the property `z-index` in
  [`@NodeStyle`](/style-script/gss-nodestyle-directive.md) and
  [`@EdgeStyle`](/style-script/gss-edgestyle-directive.md) directives. It works
  the same as the CSS z-index property.
- Set up transparent colors with the [new GSS
  functions](/style-script/gss-functions.md) `RGBA` and `HSLA`. You can also get
  the transparency value with the function `Alpha`.
- [New functions](/style-script/gss-functions.md) allow more customizations: `Sort`, `Coalesce`, `Reverse`,
  `IsMap`, `AsMap`, `Execute`, `Get`, `Set`, `Del`, `MapKeys`, `MapValues`,
  `AsIterator`, `IsIterator`, `Next`
- [Global and local
    variables](/memgraph-lab/graph-style-script-language#caching-results-for-faster-performance)
    make developing new styles easier:
  - Variable graph is now available outside `@NodeStyle` and `@EdgeStyle`
    context
  - Local variables can be defined with `Define` within `@NodeStyle` and
    `@EdgeStyle` context
- Memgraph Lab is now packaged as an RPM package and arm64 (M1 chip) for MacOS.

### Bug fixes

- Running a selected part of the Cypher query would just place that selected
  part in the run history. Now, the full query will be saved in the run history,
  and on its run, only the selected part will be executed again.
- Rows that would hide when scrolling the data results view now preview as expected.
- The System Default style colors all the nodes with the same label with a
  unique color.
- When showing a graph view on a map, you will no longer see a progress
  percentage which is unnecessary as each node has a fixed and known position
  due to its latitude and longitude values.
- All tables across the Lab are responsive as expected.
- Layouts no longer cause memory leaks and work as expected.
- By fixing a bug, you can now successfully connect to Memgraph using a hostname
  that contains numbers in the top-level domain.
- Markdown lists in query descriptions are indented as expected.

## Lab v2.6.0 - Apr 20, 2023

### What's new

- If you execute multiple Cypher queries, you can now view the result of each
  query instead of viewing just the last result.
  ![results](./data/lab-260/results.png)
- Besides exporting query results to JSON, you can also export them to CSV and
  TSV file format.
  ![download](./data/lab-260/download.png)
- If the dataset contains millions or billions nodes and relationships, their
  count in the status bar will be in the following format: X.XXM or X.XXB.
- Syntax of code blocks in the query collection description can now be
  highlighted by using one of the following language
  styles: `cypher`, `bash`, `python`, `css`, `c`, `cpp`, `json`, `sql`,
  and `yaml`. Check the examples of syntax highlighting in the [Markdown
  Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting).
  ![markdown](./data/lab-260/markdown.png)
- [New functions of the Graph Style Script
  language](/style-script/gss-functions.md) used for customizing graph appearance
  are: `Reduce`, `Sum`, `Avg`, `Min`, `Max`, `IsArray`, `Hue`, `Saturation`,
  `Lightness`, `HSL`.
  ![gss](./data/lab-260/gss.png)

### Bug fixes

- The initial node count has been removed from the connection initialization so
  connecting to the Memgraph instance containing a huge number of nodes will no
  longer cause a timeout. 
- Run History now logs queries as expected.
- When switching between the map view and the default view the graph view no
  longer becomes unresponsive. 
- Using a new line character `\n` in the query module doesn’t result in a new
  line, but an explicit character `\n`.
- Viewing the code of multiple query modules in the split screen now
  works as expected.
- Notifications no longer mix with the Query Editor and Query Collections visual
  elements.
- Pressing CMD/CTRL + S will save a query within a query collection execution section as intended.
- The autosave in query collection is now triggered on every query run as it was
  intended.
- Running a selected portion of the query won’t remove the rest of the query
  from the query collection execution view.
- GSS `Blue` function was returning a wrong number. It is fixed now. `Lighter`
  and `Darker` functions now work correctly as well because they were depending
  on the output from the `Blue` function.
  
## Lab v2.5.0 - Mar 17, 2023

### What's New

* If there are several Cypher queries in the query editor you can select a single query and run
  it without commenting out all the other queries.

![run-selected-query-in-the-lab](./data/lab-run-selected-demo.gif)

* You can now open multiple query executions views side by side and compare query execution speed or results.

![multiple-query-executions-in-the-lab](./data/lab-multiple-editors-demo.gif)

* Query modules are now sorted alphabetically for easier and faster browsing. A search box has also been added to query modules with more
  than 5 procedures to help narrow them down (e.g. `nxalg` query module has [49 procedures](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/query-modules/python/nxalg)).
* When rendering a graph with more than 3,500 nodes or 8,500 relationships, which might take considerable amount of time to preview, you will be
  asked if you want to proceed with the graph visualization or switch to the data view.
* Besides manually saving changes in the Cypher query and GSS style editor in the query collections section, they will also be saved
  automatically after each query run.
* Memgraph Lab will now notify you of any product updates and offer various tips and tricks for using the Memgraph ecosystem.

### Bug Fixes

* Cypher code suggestions can now handle labels and properties of 250k nodes and 500k relationships, compared to the previous limit of
  100k nodes nad 200k relationships.
* Multiple scrollable elements of the query collections was making scrolling difficult. Now you can focus on a particular element and
  scroll through it by clicking on it.
* Browser's back button is now working as expected when using Lab as a web application.
* Data in the query results, query modules and query run history tables now loads faster making the scrolling smoother and improving
  the user experience.
* Graph schema is now generated even if the database has no relationships.
* In-progress feedback when generating graph schema and exporting datasets for graphs with more than 10M nodes
  is now previewed as expected.
* A scrolling issue with expanded results in the Data view where you couldn't see a completely expanded row because the
  scroll would jump to the next row is now fixed.
* Dataset cards no longer spread apart when conducting a search. 

## v2.4.0 - Dec 2, 2022

### What's New

* Memgraph Lab now supports manual transaction workflows you can construct using transaction commands `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
* Cypher intellisense has been updated to suggest new Cypher features from Memgraph 2.4.0 such as:
  * Privileges for user-role authorization.
  * Commands and privileges for label-based authorization.
  * Manual transaction commands: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
  * Checking configuration with `SHOW CONFIG`.
  * All shortest path algorithm `allShortest`.
  * Graph projection function `project`.
  * Additional query module signature that accepts a projected graph as an optional first argument.
* Graph results view will check for nodes and relationships in arrays and projected graphs. It simplifies
  the visualization of a projected graph or an array of nodes/relationships without using `UNWIND`.

### Bug Fixes

* Once the table results view is selected, the results of the following query run will also preview in the table results view, instead of automatically switching to the graph view.
* Exploring a dataset's query collection now works as expected. It opens up a list of queries that can be used to explore the dataset.
* Failed queries from the rich collections now return a detailed error message.
* _Save code changes_ button in rich collections will now be enabled only if there are unsaved changes for the Cypher query 
  or GSS.
* A bug that would only show the first node label instead of all node labels in the table results view has been fixed.

## v2.3.1 - Nov 4, 2022

### Bug Fixes

* Writing a single-line comment in the Cypher code no longer results in an error.
* Having different map tiles (e.g. "light" map tile on one map view, but "dark" map tile on another map view) for multiple graph map views in the rich collection is enabled and works as expected.
* Graph rendering freeze when toggling the map view on/off during the graph rendering process has been fixed.
* All the information about nodes and edges on the graph schema is now previewed as expected.
* A bug that would mix query title and description when queries are reordered in the rich query collection has been fixed.
* A bug that would not reset the description field when adding a new query to the query collection has been fixed.
* Saving a new style now works as expected. The active style is saved, not the last applied one.

## v2.3.0 - Oct 24, 2022

### What's New

* Add new updates to the prepared datasets:
  * Add a search bar for searching and filtering datasets.
  * Add featured (highlighted) datasets.
  * Add rich collections with prepared queries, descriptions, and GSS for each dataset.
* Add new updates to the latest queries:
  * Change the name from "Latest queries" to "Run history" because it contains both queries and GSS changes.
  * Show GSS changes in the "Run history" section.
* Replace previous collections with "Rich collections":
  * Add more context to each collected query: title, markdown description, Cypher query, and GSS.
  * Add the ability to run multiple query executions within the query collection.
  * Add import and export functionality of a collection.
* Add a new version of GSS:
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle` to configure physics, link distance, repel force, and view type (`default` or `map`).
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle.Map` to configure map tiles for map view.
  * Add new GSS functions: `Slice`, `Split`, `Replace`, `Trim`, `Nodes`, `Edges`, `IsNumber`, `IsBoolean`, `IsString`, `IsNull`.
  * Add new GSS node properties `latitude` and `longitude` used to define the latitude and longitude of each node for the map view.
* Integrate graph visualization library `orb`.
* Add the ability to enable/disable map background view for nodes with geo information.
* Add the ability to connect to Neo4j, load datasets, and run Cypher queries.
