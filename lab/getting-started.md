**Memgraph Lab** is a lightweight and intuitive **visual user interface** that
enables you to:

- visualize graph data
- write and execute Cypher queries
- import and export data
- view and optimize query performance
- develop query modules in Python

It was designed to help you with every stage of your learning process and graph
development.

## Quick start

If you would like to query a running Memgraph database instance using **Memgraph
Lab**, be sure to:

### 1. Install Memgraph Platform or Memgraph Lab

We recommend you [install **Memgraph Platform**](/memgraph/installation) and get
the complete streaming graph application platform that includes **MemgraphDB**,
command-line tool **mgconsole**, visual user interface **Memgraph Lab** running
within the browser and **MAGE** - graph algorithms and modules library.

If you already have a running Memgraph database instance, you can install
Memgraph Lab as a desktop application on [Windows](/installation/windows.md),
[macOS](/installation/macos.md) or [Linux](/installation/linux.md).

### 2. Connect to Memgraph

[Connect Memgraph Lab to Memgraph](/connect-to-memgraph.md) and start
experimenting with data and Cypher.

### 3. Check out Graph Style Script

To give your graphs a bit more pizzazz, dive into the [Graph Style Script
language](/style-script/overview.md) and learn how to customize the visual
appearance of your graphs to make them truly remarkable.

### 4. Browse through the Changelog

Want to know what's new in Memgraph Lab? Take a look at
[Changelog](/changelog.md) to see a list of new features.

## What to do next?

You can also execute queries using Memgraph's command-line tool
[mgconsole](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph/mgconsole).

Those who are new to querying can head out to our
[Tutorials](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/tutorials) or play around on
[Playground](https://playground.memgraph.com/) to get a feeling of what is
possible to find out from data using graphs. The [Cypher
manual](https://memgraph.com/docs/cypher-manual/) will give you an overview of
clauses and functions to help you write awesome queries.

If you need more magic to enhance your graph power, look into [MAGE - Memgraph
Advanced Graph Extensions](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage) that will provide you
with various graph algorithms and modules in the form of query modules.
