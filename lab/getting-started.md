**Memgraph Lab** is a lightweight and intuitive **visual user interface** that enables you to: 

- visualize graph data
- write and execute Cypher queries
- import and export data
- view and optimize query performance

It was designed to help you with every stage of your learning process and graph
development.

## Quick start

If you would like to query a running Memgraph database instance using
**Memgraph Lab** be sure to: 

### 1. Install Memgraph Lab 

Install Memgraph Lab on the operating system of your choice -
[Windows](/installation/windows.md), [macOS](/installation/macos.md) or
[Linux](/installation/linux.md).

### 2. Connect to Memgraph

[Connect Memgraph Lab to Memgraph](/connect-to-memgraph.md) and start experimenting with data and Cypher.

### 3. Check out Style script

To give your graphs a bit more pizzazz, dive into the [Style script
language](/style-script/quick-start.md) and learn how to customize the visual
appearance of your graphs to make them truly remarkable.

### 4. Browse through the Changelog

Want to know what's new in Memgraph Lab? Take a look at [Changelog](/changelog.md)

## What to do next?

If you prefere to go back to black you can also execute queries using Memgraph's
command-line tool
[mgconsole](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph/mgconsole). 

Those who are new to querying can head out to our
[Tutorials](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/tutorials) or play around on
[Playground](https://playground.memgraph.com/) to get a feeling of what is
possible to find out from data using graphs. [Cypher
manual](https://memgraph.com/docs/cypher-manual/) will give you an overview of
clauses and functions to help you write awesome queries. 

If you need more magic to enhance your graph power, look into [MAGE - Memgraph
Advanced Graph Extensions](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage) that will provide you
with various graph algorithms and modules in the form of query modules.
