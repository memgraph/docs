This section will teach you how to use object graph mapper (OGM) and query
builder from the GQLAlchemy. Here you will find step-by-step guides for the most
common usage of OGM and query builder, depending on the current GQLAlchemy
capabilities. If you are a Python developer not that familiar with Cypher query
language, you will find the how-to guides very useful.

## Object graph mapper

Object graph mapper (OGM) in GQLAlchemy maps Python classes to nodes and
relationships in graph database and converts function calls to Cypher queries.
To learn more about how to use OGM, take a look at the following pages:

- [**Map nodes and
  relationships**](/how-to-guides/ogm/map-nodes-and-relationships.md)
- [**Save nodes and
  relationships**](/how-to-guides/ogm/save-nodes-and-relationships.md)
- [**Load nodes and
  relationships**](/how-to-guides/ogm/load-nodes-and-relationships.md)

## Query builder

When working with GQLAlchemy, you can connect to the database and execute Cypher
queries using the query builder. To learn more about how to create a query using
query builder, check out the following how-to guide:

- [**Creates nodes and
  relationships**](/how-to-guides/query-builder/create-nodes-relationships.md)
- [**Return results**](/how-to-guides/query-builder/return-results.md)
- [**Filter data by properties**](/how-to-guides/query-builder/filter-data.md)
- [**Call query module
  procedures**](/how-to-guides/query-builder/call-procedures.md)
- [**Delete and remove
  objects**](/how-to-guides/query-builder/delete-remove-objects.md)

## Stream & trigger support

You can create streams and database triggers directly from GQLAlchemy. Check out
the following guides:

- [**Kafka streams**](/how-to-guides/streams/kafka-streams.md)
- [**Pulsar streams**](/how-to-guides/streams/pulsar-streams.md)
- [**Triggers**](/how-to-guides/triggers/triggers.md)
