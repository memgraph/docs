This section will teach you how to use object graph mapper (OGM) and query builder from the GQLAlchemy. Here you will find step-by-step guides for the most common usage of OGM and query builder, depending on the current GQLAlchemy capabilities. If you are a Python developer not that familiar with Cypher query language, you will find the how-to guides very useful.

## Object graph mapper

Object graph mapper (OGM) in GQLAlchemy maps Python classes to nodes and relationships in graph database and converts function calls to Cypher queries. To learn more about how to use OGM, take a look at the following pages:


- [**Map nodes and relationships**](/how-to-guides/ogm/map-nodes-and-relationships.md)
- [**Save nodes and relationships**](/how-to-guides/ogm/save-nodes-and-relationships.md)
- [**Load nodes and relationships**](/how-to-guides/ogm/load-nodes-and-relationships.md)

## Query builder

When working with the GQLAlchemy, you can connect to the database and execute Cypher queries using query builder. To learn more about how to create a query using query builder, check out the following how-to guide:

- [**Create query**](/how-to-guides/query-builder/create-query.md)
