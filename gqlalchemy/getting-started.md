**GQLAlchemy** is a fully open-source Python library that aims to be the go-to
**Object Graph Mapper** (OGM) -- a link between Graph Database objects and Python
objects.

An Object Graph Mapper or OGM provides a developer-friendly workflow that allows
for writing object-oriented notation to communicate to a graph database. Instead
of writing Cypher queries, you will be able to write object-oriented code, which
the OGM will automatically translate into Cypher queries.

## Quick start

### 1. Install GQLAlchemy

Either install GQLAlchemy through [pip](/installation.md#pip) or [build it from
source](/installation.md#source).

### 2. Learn how to use the OGM

With the help of the [OGM
guide](/how-to-guides/ogm/save-nodes-and-relationships.md) you can learn how to
save nodes and relationships you have created. 

### 3. Learn how to use the query builder

There is no need to learn the Cypher query language when you can use the [query
builder](/how-to-guides/query-builder/create-query.md) in GQLAlchemy to perform
the same tasks.
