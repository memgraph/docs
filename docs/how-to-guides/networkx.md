NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure,
dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Memgraph currently provides three query modules
that utilize the NetworkX library:
* **[NetworkX Algorithms](/mage/query-modules/python/nxalg)**
* **[Graph Analyzer](/mage/query-modules/python/graph-analyzer)**
* **[Weakly Connected Components](/mage/query-modules/cpp/weakly-connected-components)**

You can also take a look at our open-source project [MAGE](/mage) which you can utilize to implement even more NetworkX functionalities inside Memgraph.
