Memgraph can natively ingest streaming data from upstream sources using [Apache
Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) and [Confluent
Platform](https://www.confluent.io). To import data using streams, you must:

1. Start Memgraph and connect to it
2. Define a transformation module
3. Create the stream in Memgraph
4. Start ingesting data from the stream

## Prerequisites

In order to create a Kafka pipeline, you must have:

- a working Kafka stream
- access to a running Memgraph instance.

## Importing data

When importing data, we should be aware of all the different nodes and
relationships our stream contains. The best practice is to have a dedicated
topic for each message type in order to parse the data more efficiently. Each
topic requires a separate procedure within a single transformation module to
handle the conversion. Once we create a stream in Memgraph and start ingesting
data, we are all set to analyze it.

### 1. Start Memgraph

[Start Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/next/installation) and
[establish a
connection](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/next/connect-to-memgraph) to the
database.

If you are starting Memgraph using a Docker image and would like to access
configuration files or logs, be sure to run the image with the following
volumes:

- `-v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph`
- `-v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph`

### 2. Define the transformation module

A transformation module is a user-defined program that receives data from Kafka
and returns processed data in the form of Cypher queries. The most common
formats received from Kafka are:

- **[JSON](/import-data/kafka/json.md)**
- **[Avro](/import-data/kafka/avro.md)**
- **[Protobuf](/import-data/kafka/protobuf.md)**.

Transformation modules can be written in either **Python** or **C**. Take a look
at the [Python API
guide](/how-to-guides/streams/kafka/implement-transformation-module.md#python-api)
for an example of how to implement transformation modules in Python.

When started, Memgraph will automatically attempt to load the query modules from
all `*.so` and `*.py` files it finds in the default
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` directory. You can point to a different
directory by changing or extending the `--query-modules-directory` flag in the
main configuration file (`/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`) or define it within a
command-line parameter when using Docker.

:::caution

Please remember that if you are using Memgraph Platform image, you should pass
configuration flags within MEMGRAPH environmental variable (e.g. `docker run -e
MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687" memgraph/memgraph-platform`) and if you are using
any other image, you should pass them as arguments after the image name (e.g.,
`memgraph/memgraph-mage --bolt-port=7687 --query-modules-directory=path/path`).

:::

<details>
  <summary>Transfer a transformation module into a Docker container</summary>
  
  If you are using Docker to run Memgraph, you will need to copy the
  transformation module file from your local directory into the Docker
  container where Memgraph can access it.

  <p> </p>

**1.** Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER ID` of the Memgraph Docker
container:

```
docker ps
```

**2.** Copy a file from your current directory to the container with the
command:

```
docker cp ./trans_module.py <CONTAINER ID>:/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/trans_module.py
```

The file is now inside your Docker container.

</details>

If the transformation module has been added to the directory while the Memgraph
instance was already running, you need to load it manually by using the
following query:

```cypher
CALL mg.load('<transformation_name>');
```

or

```cypher
CALL mg.load_all;
```

If you want to check if your module has properly loaded in Memgraph run:

```cypher
CALL mg.transformations() YIELD *;
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```cypher
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| name                                                  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| "transformation_name.my_transformation_module"        |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 3. Create a stream in Memgraph

First, make sure Kafka and Memgraph are running, and there is a topic available.
Then, make sure the transformation module is loaded

Create the stream in Memgraph with the following query:

```cypher
CREATE KAFKA STREAM <stream_name>
TOPICS <topic1>[, <topic2>, ...]
TRANSFORM <transformation_module.transformation_procedure>
[BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS <bootstrap servers>];
```

You need to create one stream for each topic and procedure you have.

For more options and information about the `CREATE .. STREAM` query check out
the [reference guide](/reference-guide/streams/overview.md).

### 4. Start ingesting data from the stream

The previous query only created the streams. To start streaming data, execute
the following query:

```cypher
START STREAM <stream_name>;
```

or

```cypher
START ALL STREAMS;
```

Your data should be slowly arriving in your Memgraph instance. To check if
everything is working, run the following query:

```cypher
CHECK STREAM <stream_name>
```

or

```cypher
SHOW STREAMS;
```

You can also check the node counter in **Memgraph Lab** (**Overview tab**) to
see if new nodes and relationships are arriving.

For all the other stream commands, check out [the reference
guide](/reference-guide/streams/overview.md).

## Logs

Errors and notifications regarding streams are contained in Memgraph's log files
which can be found at `/var/log/memgraph/memgraph_<date>.log` Look for the name
of your stream in the log file to find the error. You can use the `grep` command
to search for the stream in the log file:

```
grep '<stream_name>' /var/log/memgraph/memgraph_<date>.log
```
