The community edition of Memgraph enables creating users that can access the
database with or without a password.

To create a user, execute the following command:

```cypher
CREATE USER user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password'];
```

Setting up a password is optional. If the password is not set, the user can
log in using any password, or none, provided that they enter the correct
username.

To set or change a user's password, use the following command:

```cypher
SET PASSWORD FOR user_name TO 'new_password';
```

To check all the users created on an instance, use:

```cypher
SHOW USERS;
```

To remove a user's password, set it to `null`:

```cypher
SET PASSWORD FOR user_name TO null;
```

To delete a user use:

```cypher
DROP USER user_name;
```

## Authentication

<Tabs
  groupId="platform"
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
    <TabItem value="docker">

**`memgraph-platform` image**

If you are using Docker and `memgraph-platform` image, you should pass the
`username` and `password` environment variables when starting Memgraph:

```terminal
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MGCONSOLE="--username <username> --password <password>" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

Example:

```terminal
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MGCONSOLE="--username vlasta --password vp" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

Upon connecting with Memgraph Lab you should select *Connect Manually* and enter
username (and password).

**`memgraph` and `memgraph-mage` images**

If you are using Docker and `memgraph` or `memgraph-mage` image enter username
and password when connecting manually to Memgraph Lab. 

If you are connecting with mgconsole you should add the username and password
flags to the `docker run` command: 

```terminal
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph --host CONTAINER_IP --username=<username> --password=<password>
```

Example:

```terminal
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph --host 172.17.0.2 --username=vlasta --password=vp
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="linux">

If you are using Linux and connecting with Memgraph Lab, select *Connect
Manually* and enter username (and password). 

When connecting with mgconsole, set
the `--username` and `--password` flags:

```terminal
./mgconsole --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7687 --username <username> --password <password>
```

Example:

```terminal
./mgconsole --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7687 --username vlasta --password vp
```
   
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Password encryption algorithm

Memgraph offers multiple password encryption algorithms:
* BCrypt
* SHA256
* SHA256 with multiple iterations (currently set to 1024 iterations)

The above algorithms can be specified at runtime using the flag `--password-encryption-algorithm` with the
appropriate values of `bcrypt`, `sha256` or `sha256-multiple`.

### BCrypt
This algorithm is the default algorithm for password encryption. It's the most secure algorithm and has the best
protection against brute-force attack. However, if you're running connecting multiple concurrent enterprise users with
passwords at the same time, it may not be the best choice for you as you might experience slower performance. The performance
is slower only during authentication of the users, and should not degrade once the connection has been established.

### SHA256 and SHA256 with multiple iterations
SHA256 is an encryption algorithm that's usually not used for password encryption but is fast and secure enough to
offer optimal performance when running a lot of concurrent opening connections to Memgraph.
