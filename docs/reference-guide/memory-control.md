In Memgraph, you can control memory usage by limiting, inspecting and
deallocating memory. 

You can control the memory usage of:
 - a whole instance by setting the `--memory-limit` within the configuration file 
 - a query by including the `QUERY MEMORY` clause at the end of a query
 - a procedure by including a `PROCEDURE MEMORY` clause

## Controlling the memory usage of an instance

By setting the `--memory-limit` flag in the configuration file, you can set
the maximum amount of memory (in MiB) that a Memgraph instance can allocate
during its runtime. If the memory limit is exceeded, only the queries that don't
require additional memory are allowed. If the memory limit is exceeded while a
query is running, the query is aborted and its transaction becomes invalid.

If the flag is set to 0, it will use the default values.
Default values are:
-  90% of the total memory if the system doesn't have swap memory.
-  100% of the total memory if the system has swap memory.

## Controlling the memory usage of a query

Each Cypher query can include the following clause at the end:

```plaintext
QUERY MEMORY ( UNLIMITED | LIMIT num (KB | MB) )
```

If you use the `LIMIT` option, you have to specify the amount of memory a query
can allocate for its execution. You can use this clause in a query only once at
the end of the query. The limit is applied to the entire query.

Examples: 
```plaintext
MATCH (n) RETURN (n) QUERY MEMORY LIMIT 10 KB;
```
```plaintext
MATCH (n) RETURN (n) QUERY MEMORY UNLIMITED;
```
## Controlling the memory usage of a procedure 

Each procedure call can contain the following clause:

```plaintext
PROCEDURE MEMORY ( UNLIMITED | LIMIT num ( KB | MB) )
```

If you use the `LIMIT` option, you can specify the amount of memory that the
called procedure can allocate for its execution. If you use the `UNLIMITED`
option, no memory restrictions will be imposed when the procedure is called. If
you don't specify the clause, the memory limit is set to a default value of 100 MB.

One procedure call can have only one `PROCEDURE MEMORY` clause at the end of the
call. If a query contains multiple procedure calls, each call can have its own
limit specification.

Examples:
```plaintext
CALL example.procedure(arg1, arg2, ...) PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT 100 KB YIELD result;
```
```plaintext
CALL example.procedure(arg1, arg2, ...) PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT 100 MB YIELD result;
```
```plaintext
CALL example.procedure(arg1, arg2, ...) PROCEDURE MEMORY UNLIMITED YIELD result;
```

## Inspecting memory usage

Run the following query to inspect memory usage:

```plaintext
SHOW STORAGE INFO;
```

Find out more about `SHOW STORAGE INFO` query on [Server stats](./server-stats.md).

## Deallocating memory

Memgraph has a garbage collector that deallocates unused objects, thus freeing
the memory. The rate of the garbage collection in seconds can be specified in
the configuration file by setting the `--storage-gc-cycle-sec`.

You can free up memory by using the following query:

```cypher
FREE MEMORY;
```

This query tries to clean up as much unused memory as possible without affecting
currently running transactions.
