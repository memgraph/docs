This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run
**Memgraph** on Linux with Docker.

**Memgraph Platform** contains:
- **MemgraphDB** - the database that holds your data
- **Memgraph Lab** - visual user interface for running queries and visualizing
  graph data
- **mgconsole** - command-line interface for running queries
- **MAGE** - graph algorithms and modules library

import BackwardCompatibilityWarning from '../../templates/_backward_compatibility_warning.mdx';

<BackwardCompatibilityWarning/>

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- **Docker Desktop** - Memgraph Platform can be installed only with Docker.<br/>
  Instructions on how to install Docker can be found on the [official Docker
  website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

:::info

Memgraph's Docker image was built with **Docker version `1.12`** and should be
compatible with all newer versions.

:::

## Install and start Memgraph Platform {#installation-guide}

Open a terminal and use the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

If successful, you should see a message similar to the following:

```console
2023-08-25 09:01:45,691 INFO Included extra file "/etc/supervisor/programs/lab.conf" during parsing
2023-08-25 09:01:45,691 INFO Included extra file "/etc/supervisor/programs/memgraph.conf" during parsing
2023-08-25 09:01:45,691 INFO Set uid to user 0 succeeded
2023-08-25 09:01:45,692 INFO supervisord started with pid 1
2023-08-25 09:01:46,696 INFO spawned: 'memgraph' with pid 7
2023-08-25 09:01:46,700 INFO spawned: 'lab' with pid 8
You are running Memgraph v2.10.1
To get started with Memgraph, visit https://memgr.ph/start
```

You can [open command-line tool
**mgconsole**](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph-platform#mgconsole) in the
terminal, and the visual user interface **Memgraph Lab** is available at
[`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

User either **mgconsole**, **Memgraph Lab** or various **drivers** to [**connect to
MemgraphDB**](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx).

## Stop Memgraph Platform {#stopping-memgraph-platform}

To stop a Memgraph database instance, run the following command:

```console
docker stop memgraph
```

## Starting Memgraph Platform {#starting-memgraph-platform}


To start a Memgraph database instance, run the following command:

```console
docker start memgraph
```

:::info
If you chose a different name for your container instead of the default
`memgraph`, or if you simply want to manage containers using their ID, follow
these steps:

1. To find the name or ID of your container, run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   This command will list all running containers. Look for the
   `memgraph/memgraph-platform` image in the list and note down the container's
   name or ID.

2. To stop the container using its ID or custom name:

   ```bash
   docker stop CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
   ```

   Replace `CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` with the actual name or ID of your container.

3. To start the container again:

   ```bash
   docker start CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
   ```

   Again, replace `CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID` with the actual name or ID of your
container. 
:::

## Configuration file and logs {#named-volumes}

If you need to access the Memgraph configuration file or logs, you will need to
specify the following volumes when starting Memgraph:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--log-level=TRACE" \
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph \
  -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph \
  -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph \
  memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

The configuration file is located in the `mg_etc` volume. The exact location of
the file depends on your specific setup, but usually it is
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf`. 

The logs will be saved to the `mg_log` volume, and the directories can usually be found in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`. 

When using Docker, you can also specify the configuration options in the `docker
run` command:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

:::caution

When working with Memgraph Platform, you should pass configuration flags inside
of environment variables.

For example, you can start the MemgraphDB image with `docker run memgraph/memgraph
--bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE`, but you should start Memgraph Platform with
`docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE"
memgraph/memgraph-platform`.

guide](/reference-guide/configuration.md).
