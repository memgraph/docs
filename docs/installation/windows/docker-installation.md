This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run
Memgraph on Windows with Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation guide make sure that you have:

- Installed **Docker**. Instructions on how to do this can be found on the
  [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Downloaded the latest **Memgraph Docker Image** which can be [found
  here](https://memgraph.com/download/).

:::info 
Memgraph's Docker image was built with **Docker version `1.12`** and
should be compatible with all newer versions.
:::

## Installation guide

If you installed Docker and downloaded the latest Memgraph Docker image, import
the image using the following command:

```
docker load -i /path/to/memgraph-<version>-docker.tar.gz
```

To start Memgraph, use the following command:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph
```

If successful, you should see a message similar to the following :

```
You are running Memgraph v1.4.0-community
```

At this point, Memgraph is ready for you to [submit
queries](/getting-started/querying/querying.md).

:::info 
The username and password for connecting to the database are empty by
default.
:::

### Stopping the database instance

To stop a Memgraph database instance, run the following command:

```
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
```

You can find the name of the container (`CONTAINER_NAME`) by running:

```
docker ps
```

### Configuration

The Memgraph configuration is available in Docker's named volume `mg_etc`. On
Linux systems, it should be in
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf`.

### Named volumes

If it happens that the named volumes are reused between different Memgraph
versions, Docker will overwrite a folder within the container with existing data
from the host machine. If a new file is introduced, or two versions of Memgraph
are not compatible, some features might not work or Memgraph might not be able
to work correctly. We strongly advise you to use different named volumes for
different Memgraph versions, or to remove the existing volume from the host with
the following command:

```
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```

### Note for Docker users

Although unlikely, some OS X/macOS users might experience minor difficulties
after the Docker installation. Instead of running on `localhost`, a Docker
container for Memgraph may be running on a custom IP address. Fortunately, that
IP address can be found as follows:

1. Determine the container ID of the Memgraph container

By issuing the command `docker ps` the user should get an output similar to the
following:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED        ...
9397623cd87e        memgraph            "/usr/lib/memgraph/m‚Ä¶"   2 seconds ago  ...
```

At this point, it is important to remember the container ID of the Memgraph
image. In our case, that is `9397623cd87e`.

2. Use the container ID to retrieve an IP of the container

```
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

The command above should yield the IP that should be used when connecting to
Memgraph and instead of `HOST` when firing up the `mg_client` with Docker, as
described in the [querying](/getting-started/querying/querying.md) section.
