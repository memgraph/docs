This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run
Memgraph on Windows with Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation guide make sure that you have:

- Installed **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. For detailed instructions,
  refer to the [Microsoft
  documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
- Installed **Docker Desktop**. Instructions on how to install Docker can be
  found on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

:::info
Memgraph's Docker image was built with **Docker version `1.12`** and
should be compatible with all newer versions.
:::

## Installation guide {#installation-guide}

**1.** Download the latest **Memgraph Docker image** from the [Download
Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/).

**2.** If you installed Docker correctly, you can import the image using the
following command in the **Comand Prompt (CMD)** or **PowerShell**:

```console
docker load -i /path-to/memgraph-<version>-docker.tar.gz
```

## Starting Memgraph

To start Memgraph, use the following command in the **Comand Prompt (CMD)** or
**PowerShell**:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 memgraph
```

:::info Docker Volumes
Docker containers donâ€™t persist data by default (all changes are lost when the
container is stopped). You need to use local volumes to store the data
permanently, which is why Memgraph is started with the `-v` flag.

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph
```

More information on Docker Volumes can be found
[here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).
:::

If successful, you should see a message similar to the following:

```console
You are running Memgraph vX.X.X
To get started with Memgraph, visit https://memgr.ph/start
```

If you want to start Memgraph with different configuration settings, check out
the [section below](#configuration). At this point, Memgraph is ready for you to
[submit Cypher queries](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx).

:::info
The username and password for connecting to the database are empty by default.
:::

## Stopping Memgraph

To stop a Memgraph database instance, run the following command:

```console
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
```

You can find the name of the container (`CONTAINER_NAME`) by running:

```console
docker ps
```

## Configuration

The Memgraph configuration is available in Docker's named volume `mg_etc`. On
Linux systems, it should be in
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf`. Keep in mind that this way
of specifying configuration options is only valid if Memgraph was started [using
volumes](#named-volumes).

When using Docker, you can also specify the configuration options in the `docker
run` command:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 memgraph --bolt-port=7687
```

To learn about all the configuration options, check out the [Reference
guide](/reference-guide/configuration.md).

## Accessing configuration files and logs

If you need to access the Memgraph configuration file or logs, you will need to
specify the following volumes when starting Memgraph through **PowerShell**:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 `
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph `
  -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph `
  -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph `
  memgraph --bolt-port=7687
```

The volume `mg_etc` contains the configuration file while the logs will be saved
to `mg_log`. The location of the volume directories depends on your specific
setup but can usually be found in
`\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\volumes\`.
