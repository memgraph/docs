This article briefly outlines the basic steps necessary to install and run
Memgraph on Windows with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

:::info

Newer versions of Memgraph are currently **not backward compatible** with older
versions. That is why you won't be able to load storage snapshots between
different versions.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation guide make sure that you have:

- The latest **Memgraph Ubuntu package** which can be downloaded from the
  [Memgraph download hub](https://memgraph.com/download/).
- Installed **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. For detailed instructions,
  refer to the [Microsoft
  documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Installation guide {#installation-guide}

**1.** Start WSL by running the following command from **PowerShell**:

```console
wsl
```

**2.** Install MemgraphDB using the latest Memgraph Ubuntu package and by running the
following command in the Ubuntu terminal:

```console
sudo dpkg -i /mnt/<drive>/Users/<windows username>/Downloads/memgraph_<version>.deb
```

**3.** Start the Memgraph server by issuing the following command:

```
sudo runuser -l memgraph -c '/usr/lib/memgraph/memgraph'
```

If successful, you should receive an output similar to the following:

```
You are running Memgraph vX.X.X
```

If you want to start Memgraph with different configuration settings, check out
the [Configuration section](#configuration).<br/>
At this point, Memgraph is ready for you
to [submit queries](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx).

:::caution
Potential installation error You could get errors while installing the package
with the above commands if you don't have all of Memgraph's dependencies
installed. The issues mostly look like the following:

```
dpkg: error processing package memgraph (--install):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
Errors were encountered while processing:
 memgraph
```

To install missing dependencies and finish the installation of the Memgraph
package, just issue the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -f
```

The above command will install all missing dependencies and will finish
configuring the Memgraph package.
:::

## Configuration

The Memgraph configuration file is available at `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. If the
configuration file is altered, Memgraph needs to be restarted. 

To learn about
all the configuration options, check out the [Reference
guide](/reference-guide/configuration.md).
