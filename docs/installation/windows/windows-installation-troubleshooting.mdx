## Issues when connecting to Memgraph

```console 
docker run memgraph 
```

While this command will start a Memgraph instance, not publishing the port will
cause problems when trying to connect to the database via **Memgraph Lab**,
**mg_client** or **mgconsole**. To avoid this, you should publish the
container's port to the host using the `-p` flag and by specifying the port:

```console 
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph 
```

## Issues with connecting **mg_client** to the database

```console 
docker run -it --entrypoint=mg_client memgraph --host HOST --use-ssl=False 
```

Although unlikely, sometimes there are issues with connecting **mg_client** to
the Docker Container’s IP address because it is running on a custom IP rather
than `localhost`. This problem is most often accompanied with the following
error:

```console 
Connection failure: Couldn't connect to 127.0.0.1:7687! 
```

To fix this issue, just replace `HOST` from the first command with
`host.docker.internal`. To find out more about networking in Docker, take a
look at [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/).

## Find the IP address of a Docker Container

Although unlikely, some users might experience minor difficulties after the
Docker installation. Instead of running on `localhost`, a Docker container for
Memgraph may be running on a custom IP address. Fortunately, that IP address can
be found as follows:

**1.** Determine the ID of the Memgraph Container by issuing the
command `docker ps`. The user should get an output similar to the following:

```console 
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED
9397623cd87e    memgraph    "/usr/lib/memgraph/m…"   2 seconds ago 
```

At this point, it is important to remember the container ID of the Memgraph
Image. In our case, that is `9397623cd87e`.

**2.** Use the this ID to retrieve the IP address of the Container:

```console 
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e 
```

The command above will yield the IP address that should be used when connecting
to Memgraph via **Memgraph Lab**, **mgconsole** or **mg_client** as described in
the [querying](/getting-started/querying/querying.md) section. Just replace
`HOST` from the following command with the appropriate IP address: 

```console 
docker run -it --entrypoint=mg_client memgraph --host HOST --use-ssl=False 
```

## Accessing files from your Windows system

Usually, you can find the Windows users directories in this location:

```console
/mnt/<drive>/Users/<username>
```

## Unable to install the Memgraph package with `dpkg`

While running the following `dpkg` command:

```bash
dpkg -i /path/to/memgraph_<version>.deb
```

you may encounter errors that resemble the following:

```console
dpkg: error processing package memgraph (--install): dependency problems -
leaving unconfigured Errors were encountered while processing: memgraph
```

These errors indicate that you don’t have all of the necessary dependencies
installed. To install the missing dependencies and finish the installation,
issue the following command:

```console
sudo apt-get install -f
```

## Multiple notes when starting Memgraph

When you start a Memgraph instance, you may see the following list of notes in
your terminal:

```console
You are running Memgraph v1.4.0-community

NOTE: Please install networkx to be able to use graph_analyzer module. Using Python:
3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
[GCC 9.3.0]

NOTE: Please install networkx to be able to use Memgraph NetworkX wrappers. Using Python:
3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
[GCC 9.3.0]

NOTE: Please install networkx, numpy, scipy to be able to use proxied NetworkX algorithms. E.g., CALL nxalg.pagerank(...).
Using Python:
3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
[GCC 9.3.0]

NOTE: Please install networkx to be able to use wcc module.
Using Python:
3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
[GCC 9.3.0]
```

If you wish to work with built-in NetworkX modules in Memgraph, you need to
install the following Python libraries: 
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) 
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)

For more information on how to install Python libraries in WSL, follow [this
guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/web-frameworks#install-python-pip-and-venv).
If you are not interested in working with query modules that depend on these
libraries, you can ignore the warnings.
