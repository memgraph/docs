## 1. Issues with connection to database

```shell
docker run memgraph 
```

While this will start your Memgraph instance, not specifying the port will cause
problems when trying to connect to Memgraph via **Memgraph Lab** or
**mgconsole**. To avoid this, you should add a port to your command:

```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph
```

## 2. Issues with connecting **mg_client** to database

```shell
docker run -it --entrypoint=mg_client memgraph --host HOST --use-ssl=False
```

Although unlikely, some users might experience minor difficulties after the
Docker installation. Instead of running on localhost, a Docker container for
Memgraph may be running on a custom IP address. Fortunately, that IP address can
be found as follows:

1) Determine the container ID of the Memgraph container By issuing the command
docker ps the user should get an output similar to the following:

```shell
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED
9397623cd87e        memgraph            "/usr/lib/memgraph/m…"   2 seconds ago  
...

At this point, it is important to remember the container ID of the Memgraph
image. In our case, that is 9397623cd87e.

2) Use the container ID to retrieve an IP of the container

```shell
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

The command above should yield the IP that should be used when connecting to
Memgraph and instead of HOST when firing up the mg_client with Docker, as
described in the [querying](/getting-started/querying/querying.md) section.

## 3. Issues with connecting **mg_console** to database

```shell
docker run -it --entrypoint=mg_client memgraph --host HOST --use-ssl=False
```

When trying to fire up the mg_console with Docker, you need to run the client.
Although unlikely, sometimes there are issues with connecting to the Docker
container’s IP address because it is running on the custom IP rather than the
localhost. If you encounter the following error:

Replace localhost with host.docker.localhost in the command.
