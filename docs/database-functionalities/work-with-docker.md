This guide serves as an explanation of how to use Docker with Memgraph and
setting up your development environment.

Memgraph supports custom, user-written Cypher procedures. It is easy to extend
built-in features by creating your own query modules. To access those query
modules, we need to take a few extra steps while using Docker and this guide
will show you how to work with them.

## Why Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a service that uses OS-level virtualization
to deliver software in packages that are called
[containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). We at Memgraph
chose Docker because of its many useful features:

* Flexibility
* Lightweight - efficient in terms of system resources
* Portable - you can build locally or deploy to the cloud
* Runs on all platforms - Windows, Linux and, macOS
* Deploy in Kubernetes

## Setting up Memgraph with Docker

To start implementing and testing custom query modules in Memgraph, it is
necessary to set up a Docker container first.

The Memgraph Docker image can be downloaded
[here](https://memgraph.com/download).

After successfully [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/),
import the Memgraph Docker image with the following command:

```console
docker load -i /path/to/memgraph-<version>-docker.tar.gz
```

To start Memgraph, use the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 \
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph \
  -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph \
  -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph \
  memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

At this point, Memgraph is ready for you to [submit
queries](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx).

For an explanation of how to write custom query modules, follow our [how-to
guide](/database-functionalities/query-modules/implement-query-modules.md).

## Find the IP address of a Docker Container {#docker-container-ip-address}

Although unlikely, some users might experience minor difficulties after the
Docker installation. Instead of running on `localhost` , a Docker container for
Memgraph may be running on a custom IP address. Fortunately, that IP address can
be found as follows:

**1.** Determine the ID of the Memgraph Container by issuing the command `docker
ps`. The user should get an output similar to the following:

```console
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED
9397623cd87e    memgraph    "/usr/lib/memgraph/mâ€¦"   2 seconds ago
```

At this point, it is important to remember the container ID of the Memgraph
Image. In our case, that is `9397623cd87e` .

**2.** Use the this ID to retrieve the IP address of the Container:

```console
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

The command above will yield the IP address that should be used when connecting
to Memgraph via **Memgraph Lab** or **mgconsole** as described in the
[querying](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx) section. Just replace `HOST` from
the following command with the appropriate IP address:

```console
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```

## Importing data

If you wish to test and run your procedures on a custom dataset, first you need
to populate the database. We will be using the CSV Import Tool which creates a
snapshot that will be used by the database to recover its state on its next
startup. Make sure that your Memgraph container is stopped and run the importer
using the following command:

```console
docker run -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph -v mg_import:/import-data \
  --entrypoint=mg_import_csv memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

You can pass CSV files containing nodes and relationships with `--nodes` and
`--relationships` flags respectively. Multiple files can be specified by
repeating either of the flags. At least one node needs to be specified, but
relationships are not required. For more information on how to structure your
CSV file, please refer to our [Import tool guide](/import-data/overview.mdx).

To import the snapshot, you will need to copy your files where Docker can see
them by creating another container and filling it with your data:

```console
docker container create --name mg_import_helper -v mg_import:/import-data busybox
docker cp nodes.csv mg_import_helper:/import-data
docker cp relationships.csv mg_import_helper:/import-data
docker rm mg_import_helper
```

To run the importer, we need to slightly modify the first command by adding the
flags for nodes and relationships:

```console
docker run -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph -v mg_import:/import-data \
  --entrypoint=mg_import_csv memgraph/memgraph-platform \
  --nodes /import-data/nodes.csv \
  --relationships /import-data/relationships.csv
```

Next time you start Memgraph, your dataset will be ready for use!

## Accessing query modules

Before running our custom procedures, we need to configure Memgraph to know
where to fetch query modules. By default, Memgraph will search for query modules
in the `usr/lib/memgraph/query-modules` directory. If you wish to change the
directory in which Memgraph searches for query modules, you can do it in one of
the following ways:
* change the `--query-modules-directory` flag in the main
  [configuration](/reference-guide/configuration.md) file located at
  `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf` or
* supply it as a command-line parameter

When supplying the path for our query module, first we need to mount the volume
containing it. **Mounting** is a process by which the operating system makes
files and directories on a storage device available for users to access via the
computer's file system. In our case, we are allowing an isolated environment of
the Docker container to access data located in our computer's file system. There
are two types of mounts in Docker:
[volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) and [bind
mounting](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/). The graphic below shows
the differences between the two mounting techniques:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-despot/images/master/docker.png"
  alt="Docker" style={{height: 360}}
/>

In context of Memgraph, we will use volume mounting meaning we are going to put
our files in a container and mount that container to the Docker area. Bind
mounts are dependant on the file system of the host machine therefore if we move
the file elsewhere, we need to re-mount. With volume binding, we have placed the
files inside the Docker area and Memgraph will always have access to it no
matter where they exist in our file system.

The following command should be used to successfully mount a volume containing
your custom query module:

```console
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 \
  -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph \
  -v $(pwd)/modules:/modules \
  -e MEMGRAPH="--query-modules-directory=/modules" \
  memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

We've added two flags to the original command:
* `-v $(pwd)/modules:/modules ` - flag for mounting the volume `modules` and
* `--query-modules-directory=/modules` - flag used to change the place where
  Memgraph searches for modules.

Now that we have access to our query modules, we can go on and run them.

## Running query modules

There are three ways to execute queries and procedures in Memgraph:

* using the command-line tool, `mgconsole`, which comes with Memgraph,
  ([Querying](/connect-to-memgraph/overview.mdx))
* [programmatically](/connect-to-memgraph/methods/drivers.md) by using the Bolt
  protocol,
* from **Memgraph Lab**, a visual user interface that can be downloaded
  [here](https://memgraph.com/download).

If you've decided to use the command-line tool, you will need to run the
following command:

```console
 docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```

`HOST` part of the command should be replaced with valid IP - most likely
 `localhost` .   If you are a macOS or Linux user and are having issues with
 connecting, please refer to the [Note for Docker
 users](#docker-container-ip-address).

:::note

If `localhost` refuses to connect, try using `host.docker.internal` instead.

:::

After running the command, you should get a command prompt similar to this one:

```
Type :help for shell usage
Quit the shell by typing Ctrl-D(eof) or :quit
Connected to 'memgraph://127.0.0.1:7687'
memgraph>
```

Query modules are loaded on start, but you can also load them by executing the
following procedure:

```cypher
CALL mg.load_all();
```

Each time you change a query module don't forget to reload it. The syntax for
calling the procedures is as follows:

```cypher
CALL example.procedure("string-argument") YIELD *;
```

Each procedure returns either zero or more records, where each record contains
named fields. The `YIELD` part is used to select fields we are interested in.
Custom procedures may be called standalone or as part of a larger query. This is
useful if we want the procedure to work on data the query is producing.

With this, your developing environment is ready and you are able to easily
implement and run your own query modules. Check out our [Reference
Guide](/reference-guide/query-modules/overview.md) to see which Query Modules
are included in Memgraph.

### Reusing volumes between Memgraph versions

If it happens that the named volumes are reused between different Memgraph
versions, Docker will overwrite a folder within the container with existing data
from the host machine. If a new file is introduced, or two versions of Memgraph
are not compatible, some features might not work, or Memgraph might not be able
to work correctly. We strongly advise you to use different named volumes for
different Memgraph versions or to remove the existing volume from the host with
the following command:

```console
docker volume rm <volume_name>
```
