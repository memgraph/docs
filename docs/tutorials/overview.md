Tutorials are guides on how to use Memgraph in real-world examples to help you
kick off your own Memgraph graph database. You can learn:

-  [basic terminology and practices related to graph databases and graph modeling](graph-modeling.md)
-  [the installation process of Memgraph on Windows 10](install-memgraph-on-windows-10.md)
-  [Cypher language used to query the Memgraph database instance](/tutorials/exploring-datasets)
-  [Style script to add style to your graphs in Memgraph Lab](style-your-graphs-in-memgraph-lab.md)
-  [migration of relational database to Memgraph](migrate-relational-database.md)
-  [how to connect Memgraph to an existing Kafka stream in order to analyze data
in real-time](graph-stream-processing-with-kafka.md)
-  [how to analyze social networks with NetworkX](social-network-analysis.md)
-  [how to extend the Cypher query language by implementing query modules](understanding-music-with-modules.md)

## Building applications and other tutorials

These articles demonstrate how to build real-world applications that use graph
analytics and how to perform complex network analysis with Memgraph. Each one
focuses on a specific problem.
