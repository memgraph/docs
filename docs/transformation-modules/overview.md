Memgraph supports user defined transformations in **C** and **Python**
that act on data received from a streaming engine. These transformations 
are grouped into modules called **Transformation modules** which can then
be loaded on startup or later on.

Articles in this section introduce transformation modules, their similarities 
with query modules and their respective API's. Currently, we only support
transformations for Kafka streams but we are aiming to add support for other 
streaming engines as well.
