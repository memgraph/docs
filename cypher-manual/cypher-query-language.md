## What is Cypher?

Cypher is a declarative query language specifically designed to efficiently
handle querying graph data. With Cypher you expresses what to retrieve, but not
how to retrieve it. This allows you to focus on the problem domain instead of
having to worry about the syntax.

Cypher was designed to be easy to learn but very powerful when it comes to graph
analytics. Otherwise, complex queries can relatively easily be written with
Cypher.
