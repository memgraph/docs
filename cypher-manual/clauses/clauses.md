The **Cypher** language enables users to perform standard database operations by using the following clauses:
  * [`MATCH`](match.md), which searches for patterns;
  * [`WHERE`](where.md), for filtering the matched data;
  * [`RETURN`](return.md), for defining what will be presented to the user in the result set;
  * [`UNION`](union.md) and [`UNION ALL`](union.md) for combining results from multiple queries;
  * [`CREATE`](create.md), for creating new nodes and edges;
  * [`SET`](set.md), for adding new or updating existing labels and properties;
  * [`DELETE`](delete.md), for deleting nodes and edges;
  * [`REMOVE`](remove.md), for removing labels and properties;
  * [`MERGE`](merge.md), for creating patterns if they do not exist;
  * [`WITH`](with.md), for combining multiple reads and writes.
  * [`LOAD CSV`](load-csv.md), for loading CSV data
