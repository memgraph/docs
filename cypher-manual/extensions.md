### Foreach

`foreach` iterates over a list of elements. Each element is stored inside a variable which can
optionally be used inside the update clauses. All update clauses are executed per iteration of the list.

```cypher
  FOREACH ( <variable name> IN <expression> | <update clauses> )
```
|         Option          |                                                         Description                                                                       |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       variable name     |                                         The variable name that stores each element                                                        |
|        expression       |                                           Any expression that results to a list                                                           |
|      update clauses     |                  One or more cypher update clauses: `SET`, `REMOVE`, `CREATE`, `MERGE`, `DELETE` including `FOREACH` extension            |

It must be noted that if the result `&lt;expression&gt;` is null, then `FOREACH` will not fail but rather skip the execution of `&lt;update clauses&gt;` altogether.

Examples: 

```cypher
  FOREACH ( i IN [1, 2, 3] | CREATE (n {id : i}) )
```
Creates 3 nodes, each with the id property set to 1, 2 and 3 respectively.


```cypher
  CREATE (n { prop : [[1, 2], [3, 4]]);

  MATCH (n) FOREACH ( inner_list IN n.prop | FOREACH ( j IN inner_list | CREATE (u { prop : j }) ) );
```
Creates 4 nodes, each with the id property set to 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

:::note
Similarly, the rest of the clauses mentioned on the table above can be used.

One more important detail of foreach, is that it supports shadowing of variables names. For example,
the query below:

```cypher
  CREATE (n { prop : 0 });

  MATCH (n) FOREACH ( i IN [1] | FOREACH ( i IN [3] |  SET n.prop = i ) );
```
will end up setting the property **prop** of the created node to 3.
