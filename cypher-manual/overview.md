**Cypher** is the most widely adopted, fully-specified, and open query language
for property graph databases. It provides an intuitive way to work with property
graphs.

### Quick start

If you are new to the **Cypher** query language take a look what you can do with few simple commands. You will use our sandbox that we have already filled with sample data. There is no need for you to install anything at this point, simply open Game of Thrones Deaths dataset on [**Memgraph playground**](https://playground.memgraph.com/sandbox/game-of-thrones-deaths). You will find some predefine queries there, but here are some additional ones.



## What are graph databases?
Is this the first time that encounter graph database? Get familiar with [graph database terminology](graph-databases.md) before you dip dive into them.

## Cypher query language
Now that you know what are graph databases let's see how you can use [Cypher query language](cypher-query-language.md) to get the job don.

## Working with Memgraph
[Memgraph](working-with-memgraph.md) has everything that you need to start working with your data and streams.

## Import data
You can easily [Import data](import-data.md) or add new data to Memgraph. Take a look how to do it.

## Connecting nodes
Memgraph is all about connections. Learn how to [connect nodes](connecting-nodes.md) with relationships. 

## Reading existing data
When you have nodes an relations ships for sure you will want to [read the existing data](reading-existing-data.md) and to learn how do you traverse relationships.

## Updating nodes and relationships
Things change over time. The same is true for your data. Learn how to [update nodes and relationships](updating-nodes-and-relationships.md) already existing data. You can even create some new data along the way.

## Deleting nodes and relationships
Somtimes you will no longer need some of the data. You can easily [deled nodes and relationships](deleting-nodes-and-relationships.md). You can even delete all fo your data, but be careful with this if you don't have backup!

## Clauses
Maybe [clauses](clauses/clauses.md) are the reason why you are here. We have created a list od all Cypher clauses that Memgraph supports.

## Using functions
Sometimes clauses are now enough to get the data that you are looking for. Don't worry, Memgraph has a lot o built in [functions](functions.md) that will help you to get the right data.
