**Cypher** is the most widely adopted, fully-specified, and open query language
for property graph databases. It provides an intuitive way to work with property
graphs.

## Quick start

If you are new to the **Cypher** query language, take a look at what you can do
with a few simple commands. You will use our sandbox that we have already filled
with sample data. There is no need for you to install anything at this point.
Simply open Game of Thrones Deaths dataset on [**Memgraph
playground**](https://playground.memgraph.com/sandbox/game-of-thrones-deaths).
You will find some predefined queries there that will help you to get a glimpse
of what you can accomplish with Cypher.

:::info

Playground supports only read operations. If you'd like to modify the dataset,
you will need to [install and run Memgraph](../memgraph/installation) on your
computer.

query language in 10 days.

## What are graph databases?

Is this your first encounter with graph databases? If so, get familiar with
[graph database terminology](graph-databases.md) before you dip dive into them.

## Cypher query language

Now that you know what graph databases are let's see how you can use [Cypher
query language](cypher-query-language.md) to get the job done.

## Working with Memgraph

[Memgraph](working-with-memgraph.md) has everything you need to start working
with your data and streams.

## Import data

You can easily [Import data](import-data.md) or add new data to Memgraph.

## Connecting nodes

Memgraph is all about connections. Learn how to [connect
nodes](connecting-nodes.md) with relationships.

## Reading existing data

When you have nodes and relationships, you will surely want to [read the
existing data](reading-existing-data.md) and learn how you traverse
relationships.

## Updating nodes and relationships

Things change over time. The same is true for your data. Learn how to [update
nodes and relationships](updating-nodes-and-relationships.md) with already
existing data. You can even create some new data along the way.

## Deleting nodes and relationships

Sometimes you will no longer need parts of the data. You can easily [delete nodes
and relationships](deleting-nodes-and-relationships.md). You can even delete all
of your data, but be careful with this if you don't have a backup!

## Clauses

Maybe [clauses](clauses/clauses.md) are the reason why you are here. We have
created a list of all Cypher clauses that Memgraph supports.

## Extension clauses

Extension clauses (for example, `FOREACH`), are additional clauses added in
Cypher query language. Jump on the
[extensions](/extension-clauses.md) page and have a look!

## Functions

Sometimes clauses are not enough to get the data you are looking for. Don't
worry, Memgraph has a lot of built-in [functions](functions.md) that will help
you to get the right data.
