## Introduction

Drug development is often expansive and time-consuming. Vast amounts of chemical
compounds need to be tested under specific conditions in order to find the most
effective ones for certain diseases. Modern drug development aims to optimize
this resource-intensive process by leveraging machine learning techniques
combined with new and effective ways of data representation. 

Machine learning is also used in early experimental stages to predict molecular
properties and significantly reduce the resources and time needed for drug
discovery. Relational databases are not equipped to handle such vast amounts of
unstrutured biological data, which is why graph databases and graph algorithms
have found a permanent foothold in the industry.

## Applying graphs

### Knowledge graph prediction of unknown adverse drug reactions

Unknown [adverse reactions to
drugs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16674-x) present a significant
health risk and limit accurate judgment. Machine learning has the potential to
predict unknown adverse reactions from current knowledge without having to rely
on new resources intensive studies and experiments. Representing relationships in
the form of a graph and performing feature extraction can result in much clearer
and more accurate predictions. Traditional AI and machine learning techniques
are not meant to detect and traverse complex relationships on such scale which
is where graph algorithms come in.
