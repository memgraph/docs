## Introduction

Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process where thousands of
chemical compounds are being tested and experiments are being conducted in order
to find out drugs that are safe and effective. Modern drug development aims to
speed up the intermediate steps and thus reduces cost by leveraging machine
learning tools on drug development, typically at drug discovery and preclinical
research stages. In short, molecular compounds are filtered through a
progressive series of tests which determine their properties, effectiveness and
toxicity for later stages. Machine leaning is increasingly being used to better
predict molecular properties in early stages can significantly reduce the load
of later processes (e.g. clinical trials), saving tons of resources as well as
time. Relational databases are not equipped to handle vast amounts of
unstrutured data.

## Applying graphs

### Knowledge graph prediction of unknown adverse drug reactions

Unknown [adverse reactions to
drugs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16674-x) available on the
market present a significant health risk and limit accurate judgement of the
cost/benefit trade-off for medications. Machine learning has the potential to
predict unknown adverse reactions from current knowledge. But representing the
relationships in the form of a graph and performing feature extraction can
results in much clearer and accurate predications. Traditioanl AI and machine
learning techniques are not mean't to detect and traverse complex relationships
on such scale which is where graph algorithms come in.
