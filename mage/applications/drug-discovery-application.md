## Introduction TODO

Drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process where thousands of
chemical compounds are being tested and experiments are being conducted in order
to find out drugs that are safe and effective. The general process of drug
development involves steps as shown in Figure 1. Modern drug development aims to
speed up the intermediate steps and thus reduces cost by leveraging machine
learning tools on drug development, typically at drug discovery and preclinical
research stages. In short, molecular compounds are filtered through a
progressive series of tests which determine their properties, effectiveness and
toxicity for later stages. Machine leaning is increasingly being used to better
predict molecular properties in early stages can significantly reduce the load
of later processes (e.g. clinical trials), saving tons of resources as well as
time.

## Applying graphs

### Knowledge graph prediction of unknown adverse drug reactions

Unknown [adverse reactions to
drugs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16674-x) available on the
market present a significant health risk and limit accurate judgement of the
cost/benefit trade-off for medications. Machine learning has the potential to
predict unknown adverse reactions from current knowledge. We constructed a
knowledge graph containing four types of node: drugs, protein targets,
indications and adverse reactions.
