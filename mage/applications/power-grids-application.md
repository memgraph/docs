## Introduction

The utility industry is undergoing a transformational period driven by
technological and competitive forces, as well as changing customer expectations
and growing regulatory constraints. As these forces accelerate, electric power
distributors must tap new technologies to expand opportunities to improve
operational efficiencies, reduce costs and maximize customer satisfaction. 

Similar to its impact on other major industries, advanced analytics have the
potential to unlock novel groundbreaking opportunities in the power grid sector.
As power grid technologies evolve in conjunction with measurement and
communication technologies, this results in an unprecedented amount of
heterogeneous and deeply interconnected data from diverse sources. The effective
combination and utilization of this electrical data with external data sources
(e.g. weather), has the potential to revolutionize electrical grid operations by
enhancing observability of system-wide conditions, the behavior of end-users,
and energy availability.
