## Abstract

This module, named **nxalg**, provides a comprehensive set of thin wrappers around most of the algorithms present in the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) package. The wrapper functions now have the capability to create a NetworkX compatible graph-like object that can stream the native database graph directly saving on memory usage significantly.

## Procedures
### `all_shortest_paths(source, target, weight, method)`

Compute all shortest simple paths in the graph. A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

#### Input:

* `source: Vertex` ➡ Starting node for the path.
* `target: Vertex` ➡ Ending node for the path.
* `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡ If `NULL`, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1. If a string, use this edge attribute as the edge weight. Any edge attribute not present defaults to 1.
* `method: string (default="dijkstra")` ➡ The algorithm to use to compute the path lengths. Supported options: ‘dijkstra’, ‘bellman-ford’. Other inputs produce a ValueError. If `weight` is `None`, unweighted graph methods are used, and this suggestion is ignored.

#### Output:

* `paths: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of vertices for a certain path.

#### Usage:
```cypher
MATCH (n:Label), (m:Label)
CALL nxalg.all_shortest_paths(n, m) YIELD *
RETURN paths;
```

### `all_simple_paths(source, target, cutoff)`

Returns all simple paths in the graph `G` from source to target. A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

#### Input:

* `target: Vertex` ➡ Ending node for the path.
* `cutoff: List[integer] (default=NULL)` ➡ Depth to stop the search. Only paths of `length <= cutoff` are returned.

#### Output:

* `paths: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of vertices for a certain path. If there are no paths between the source and target within the given cutoff there is no output.

node (and all edges incident on that node) will not disconnect the
subgraph. Note that nodes may be part of more than one biconnected
component.  Those nodes are articulation points or cut vertices.  The
removal of articulation points will increase the number of connected
components of the graph.

Notice that by convention a dyad is considered a biconnected component.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.biconnected_components() YIELD *
RETURN components;
```


### `bridges(root)`

A *bridge* in a graph is an edge whose removal causes the number of
connected components of the graph to increase.  Equivalently, a bridge is an
edge that does not belong to any cycle.

The *chain decomposition* of a graph with respect to a depth-first
search tree is a set of cycles or paths derived from the set of
fundamental cycles of the tree in the following manner. Consider
each fundamental cycle with respect to the given tree, represented
as a list of edges beginning with the non tree edge oriented away
from the root of the tree. For each fundamental cycle, if it
overlaps with any previous fundamental cycle, just take the initial
non-overlapping segment, which is a path instead of a cycle. Each
cycle or path is called a *chain*.

#### Input:

* `root: Vertex[NULL]` ➡   Optional. A node in the graph `G`. If specified, only the chain decomposition for the connected component containing this node will be returned. This node indicates the root of the depth-first Search tree.

#### Output:

### `edge_bfs(source, orientation)`
A directed, breadth-first-search of edges in `G`, beginning at `source`.

Return the edges of `G` in a breadth-first-search order continuing until
all edges are generated.


#### Input:

* `source: Vertex` ➡  The node from which the traversal begins. If `None`, then a source is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in the graph are searched.
* `orientation: string (default=NULL)` ➡  For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not respect the original orientation of the edges. When set to ‘reverse’, every edge is traversed in the reverse direction. When set to ‘ignore’, every edge is treated as undirected. When set to ‘original’, every edge is treated as directed. In all three cases, the returned edge tuples add a last entry to indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed. If `orientation` is `None`, the returned edge has no direction indicated. The direction is respected, but not reported.

#### Output:

* `edges: List[Edges]` ➡ A directed edge indicating the path taken by the breadth-first-search. For graphs, edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal. For multigraphs, edge is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then u and `v` are always in the order of the actual directed edge. If `orientation` is not `None` then the edge tuple is extended to include the direction of traversal (‘forward’ or ‘reverse’) on that edge.

#### Usage:
```cypher
MATCH (source:Label)
CALL nxalg.edge_bfs(source, 'ignore') YIELD *
RETURN source, edges;
```
### `edge_dfs(source, orientation)`

A directed, depth-first-search of edges in `G`, beginning at `source`.

Return the edges of `G` in a depth-first-search order continuing until
all edges are generated.

#### Input:

* `source: Vertex (default=NULL)` ➡  The node from which the traversal begins. If `None`, then a source is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in the graph are searched.
* `orientation: string (default=NULL)` ➡  For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals
need not respect the original orientation of the edges.
When set to ‘reverse’, every edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
When set to ‘ignore’, every edge is treated as undirected.
When set to ‘original’, every edge is treated as directed.
In all three cases, the returned edge tuples add a last entry to
indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed.
If `orientation` is `None`, the returned edge has no direction indicated.
The direction is respected, but not reported.

#### Output:

* `edges: List[Edge]` ➡ A directed edge indicating the path taken by the depth-first traversal.
For graphs, edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v`
are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal.
For multigraphs, edge is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is
the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` and `v`
are always in the order of the actual directed edge.
If `orientation` is not `None` then the edge tuple is extended to include
the direction of traversal (‘forward’ or ‘reverse’) on that edge.

#### Usage:
```cypher
MATCH (source:Label)
CALL nxalg.edge_dfs(source, 'original') YIELD *
RETURN source, edges;
```
### `find_cliques()`

Returns all maximal cliques in an undirected graph.

For each node `v`, a *maximal clique* for `v` is the largest complete
subgraph containing `v`. The largest maximal clique is sometimes
called the *maximum clique*.

This function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a
list of nodes. It is an iterative implementation, so should not
suffer from recursion depth issues.

#### Output:

* `cliques: List[List[Vertex]]` ➡ An iterator over maximal cliques, each of which is a list of
nodes in `G`. The order of cliques is arbitrary.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.find_cliques() YIELD *
RETURN cliques;
```
### `find_cycle(source, orientation)`

Returns a cycle found via depth-first traversal.

A *cycle* is a closed path in the graph.
The orientation of directed edges is determined by `orientation`.

#### Input:

* `source: List[Vertex] (default=NULL)` ➡  The node from which the traversal begins. If `None`, then a source is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in the graph are searched.
* `orientation: string (default=NULL)` ➡  For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals
need not respect the original orientation of the edges. When set to ‘reverse’ every edge is traversed in the reverse direction. When set to ‘ignore’, every edge is treated as undirected. When set to ‘original’, every edge is treated as directed. In all three cases, the yielded edge tuples add a last entry to indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed. If `orientation` is `None`, the yielded edge has no direction indicated. The direction is respected, but not reported.

#### Output:

* `   ` ➡ A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop. If no cycle is found, then an exception is raised. For graphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are the tail and the head of the edge as determined by the traversal. For multigraphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` and `v` are always in the order of the actual directed edge. If `orientation` is not `None` then the edge tuple is extended to include the direction of traversal (‘forward’ or ‘reverse’) on that edge.

#### Usage:
```cypher
MATCH (source:Label)
CALL nxalg.find_cycle(source) YIELD *
RETURN source, edges;
```

### `flow_hierarchy(weight)`

Returns the flow hierarchy of a directed network.

*Flow hierarchy* is defined as the fraction of edges not participating in cycles in a directed graph.

#### Input:

* `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡  Attribute to use for node weights. If `None`, the weight defaults to 1.

#### Output:

* `flow_hierarchy: double` ➡  Flow hierarchy value.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.flow_hierarchy() YIELD *
RETURN flow_hierarchy;
```
### `global_efficiency()`

Returns the average global efficiency of the graph. The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes in a graph is the multiplicative inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *average global efficiency* of a graph is the average efficiency of all pairs of nodes.

#### Output:

* `global_efficiency: double` ➡  The average global efficiency of the graph.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.global_efficiency() YIELD *
RETURN global_efficiency;
```
### `greedy_color(strategy, interchange)`
Color a graph using various strategies of greedy graph coloring. Attempts to color a graph using as few colors as possible, where no neighbors of a node can have the same color as the node itself. The given strategy determines the order in which nodes are colored.


#### Input:

* `strategy` ➡  The parameter `function(G,colors)` is a function (or a string representing a function) that provides the coloring strategy, by returning nodes in the order they should be colored. `G` is the graph, and `colors` is a dictionary of the currently assigned colors, keyed by nodes. The function must return an iterable over all the nodes in `G`. If the strategy function is an iterator generator (a function with
`yield` statements), keep in mind that the `colors` dictionary will be updated after each `yield`, since this function chooses colors greedily. If `strategy` is a string, it must be one of the following, each of which represents one of the built-in strategy functions.
`'largest_first'`
`'random_sequential'`
`'smallest_last'`
`'independent_set'`
`'connected_sequential_bfs'`
`'connected_sequential_dfs'`
`'connected_sequential'` (alias for the previous strategy)
`'saturation_largest_first'`
`'DSATUR'` (alias for the previous strategy)
* `interchange: boolean (default=False)` ➡  Will use the color interchange algorithm if set to `True`. Note that `saturation_largest_first` and `independent_set` do not work with interchange. Furthermore, if you use interchange with your own strategy function, you cannot rely on the values in the `colors` argument.
#### Output:

* `node: Vertex` ➡ Vertex to color.
* `color: integer` ➡ Color index of a certain node.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.greedy_color('connected_sequential_bfs') YIELD *
RETURN node, color;
```
### `has_eulerian_path()`

 An *Eulerian path* is a path in a graph that uses each edge of a graph exactly once.
 A directed graph has an Eulerian path if:
* at most one vertex has `out_degree - in_degree = 1`,
* at most one vertex has `in_degree - out_degree = 1`,
* every other vertex has equal in_degree and out_degree,
* and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component of the underlying undirected graph.
 An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if exactly zero or two vertices have an odd degree and all of its vertices with nonzero degrees belong to a single connected component.

#### Output:

* `has_eulerian_path: boolean` ➡ `True` if `G` has an eulerian path.

### `node_connectivity(source, target)`
Returns an approximation for node connectivity for a graph or digraph `G`.

*Node connectivity* is equal to the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect `G` or render it trivial. By Menger’s theorem, this is equal to the number of node independent paths (paths that share no nodes other than `source` and `target`).
 If `source` and `target` nodes are provided, this function returns the local node connectivity: the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to break all paths from source to `target` in `G`.
 This algorithm is based on a fast approximation that gives a strict lower bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes. It works for both directed and undirected graphs.

### `non_randomness(k)`

The second computed value `relative_non_randomness` is a relative measure that indicates to what extent graph `G` is different from random graphs in terms of probability. When it is close to 0, the graph tends to be more likely generated by an Erdos Renyi model.
#### Input:

The dict key is the node the outedge points to and the dict value is the weight of that outedge. By default, dangling nodes are given outedges according to the personalization vector (uniform if not specified). This must be selected to result in an irreducible transition matrix. It may be common to have the dangling dict to be the same as the personalization dict.

RETURN components;
```
### `topological_sort()`
Returns nodes in topologically sorted order.
 A *topological sort* is a non unique permutation of the nodes such that an edge from `u` to `v` implies that `u` appears before `v` in the topological sort order.
#### Output:

* `nodes: List[Vertex]` ➡   A list of nodes in topological sorted order.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.topological_sort() YIELD *
RETURN nodes;
```
### `triadic_census()`
Determines the triadic census of a directed graph. The *triadic census* is a count of how many of the 16 possible types of triads are present in a directed graph.

#### Output:

* `triad: string` ➡  Triad name.
* `count: integer` ➡  Number of occurrences as value.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.triadic_census() YIELD *
RETURN triad, count;
```
### `voronoi_cells(center_nodes, weight)`
Returns the Voronoi cells centered at center_nodes with respect to the shortest-path distance metric.
 If `C` is a set of nodes in the graph and `c` is an element of `C`, the *Voronoi cell* centered at a node `c` is the set of all nodes
`v` that are closer to `c` than to any other center node in `C` with respect to the shortest-path distance metric.
 For directed graphs, this will compute the “outward” Voronoi cells in which distance is measured from the center nodes to the target node.

#### Input:

* `center_nodes: List[Vertex]` ➡  A nonempty set of nodes in the graph `G` that represent the centers of the Voronoi cells.
* `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡  The edge attribute (or an arbitrary function) representing the weight of an edge. This keyword argument is as described in the documentation for `networkx.multi_source_dijkstra_path`, for example.

#### Output:

* `center: Vertex` ➡ Vertex value of center_nodes.
* `cell: List[Vertex]` ➡  Partition of `G` closer to that center node.

#### Usage:
```cypher
MATCH (n)
WITH COLLECT(n) AS center_nodes
CALL nxalg.voronoi_cells(center_nodes) YIELD *
RETURN center, cell;
```
### `wiener_index(weight)`
Returns the Wiener index of the given graph.
 The *Wiener index* of a graph is the sum of the shortest-path distances between each pair of reachable nodes. For pairs of nodes in undirected graphs, only one orientation of the pair is counted.
#### Input:

* `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡ The edge attribute to use as distance when computing shortest-path distances. This is passed directly to the
`networkx.shortest_path_length` function.

#### Output:

* `wiener_index: double` ➡  The Wiener index of the graph `G`.

#### Usage:
```cypher
CALL nxalg.voronoi_cells() YIELD *
RETURN wiener_index;
```
