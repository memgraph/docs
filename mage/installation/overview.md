:::note

The **Docker Hub** and **Docker build** installation methods only requery you to
[install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) while the **Build from
source on Linux** method requires the installation of additional dependancies.

:::

There are three methods to install and use MAGE locally:

1. **[Docker Hub](/installation/docker-hub.md)** (recommended method ✔️)
2. **[Docker build](/installation/docker-build.md)**
3. **[Install from source on Linux](/installation/source.md)**
