## Installing with Docker Hub

Memgraph has prepared a docker image on [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph-mage) :whale:  ready to be pulled from
[memgraph/memgraph-mage](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph-mage).

**1.** This is the only command you will need to make it run in your environment:

```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

:::info
Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance
was already running you will need to execute the following query to load them:

```shell
CALL mg.load_all();
```

If you want to find out more about loading query modules, visit [this
