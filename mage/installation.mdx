## Prerequisites

To build and install MAGE query modules you will need: **Python3**, **Make**,
**CMake** and **Clang**.

## Installing with Docker Hub 

In [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/) :whale:, Memgraph has prepared docker image ready to be pulled from 
[memgraph/memgraph-mage](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph-mage). 

**2.** This is the only command you will need to make it run in your environment:  

```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

:::info
Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance
was already running you will need to execute the following query to load them:

```shell
CALL mg.load_all();
```

guide](/usage/loading-modules.md).

## Installing with Docker 

**1.** Make sure to have the `memgraph:latest` Docker Image either from [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/download)
 or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph). 

**2.** Build the **MAGE** tagged Docker image with the following command:  

```shell
docker build . -t memgraph-mage
```

**3.** Start Memgraph with the following command and enjoy **MAGE**:

```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph-mage
```

Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup so if your instance
was already running you will need to execute the following query to load them:

## Installing from source 

**1.** Run the `build` script. It will generate a `dist` directory with all the
needed files.  

```shell
python3 build
```

**2.** Copy the contents of the newly created `dist` directory to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`.  
**3.** Start Memgraph and enjoy **MAGE**!
