### What is Memgraph?

**Memgraph** is a native in-memory graph streaming platform built to handle real-time
use-cases at enterprise scale. Memgraph supports strongly-consistent ACID
transactions and uses the standardized **Cypher** query language for
structuring, manipulating, and exploring data. You can connect to Kafka and use Memgraph
to wrangle your graph data source.

### What is MAGE?

**MAGE** stands for **Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions**. Itâ€™s an open-source
project started by Memgraph that encourages developers to share innovative and
useful **query modules** (custom Cypher procedures) so the whole community can
benefit from them.

### What are query modules?

**Query modules** are essentially collections of custom Cypher procedures that
extend the basic functionalities of the Cypher query language. Each query module
consists of procedures that are connected by a common theme (community detection
for example). You can implement them using a Python or a C API.

### What is Cypher?

data from a graph database.
