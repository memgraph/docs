## Machine Learning Graph Algorithms

Graph machine learning makes it possible to [infer new relationships](/mage/algorithms/machine-learning-graph-analytics/link-prediction-algorithm), 
[predict label for new node](/mage/algorithms/machine-learning-graph-analytics/node-classification-algorithm). MAGE covers
both use cases in static and streaming setup. To learn more about streaming setup, jump to tutorial which covers [stream processing with Kafka](/memgraph/tutorials/graph-stream-processing-with-kafka).

### [Temporal Graph Networks](/mage/query-modules/python/temporal-graph-networks)
* streaming algorithm for node classification or link prediction

### [Node Classification](/mage/query-modules/python/node-classification-with-gnn)
* static algorithm for node classification 

### [Link Prediction](/mage/query-modules/python/link-prediction-with-gnn)
* static algorithm for link prediction


### [Node2Vec](/mage/query-modules/python/node2vec)
* provides low-level embeddings for graph nodes
