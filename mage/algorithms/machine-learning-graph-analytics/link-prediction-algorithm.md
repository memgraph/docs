## Description

Link prediction is the process of predicting the probability of merging two nodes that were not previously merged in a graph. A wide range of different solutions can be applied to such a problem.

The problem is of great importance in referral systems, co-authorship prediction, and drug discovery.

Solving methods range from traditional to machine learning. Traditional methods are mostly based either on a neighborhood cross-section and say a link between two nodes is more likely to exist if there are many common neighbors. These are:
1. Jaccard similarity
2. Overlap similarity
3. Adamic-Adar index

On the other hand, such a prediction can be learned from the nodes by looking at similarity metrics. The more similar the nodes, the greater the likelihood of connectivity. **Cosine similarity** and **Euclidean distance** are one example of such.

Then, there are the most advanced models so far and they are based on **graph embeddings**, which serve as features for further classification tasks. Likewise, it is possible to drive **graph neural network (GNN)** methods for the same task.

> _Our little magician Memgraph MAGE has recently received one more spell - the Online Node2Vec algorithm. Since he is still too scared to use it, you, as a brave spirit, will step up and use it on a real challenge to show MAGE how itâ€™s done. This challenge includes building an Online Recommendation System using k-means clustering and the newborn spell - Online Node2Vec algorithm._
