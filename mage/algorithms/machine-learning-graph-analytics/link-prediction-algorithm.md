## Description

[Link prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/link-prediction) is the process of predicting the probability of connecting the two nodes that were not previously connected in a graph. A wide range of different solutions can be applied to such a problem.

The problem is of great importance in recommendation systems, co-authorship prediction, drug discovery, and many, many more.

Solving methods range from traditional to machine learning-based. Traditional methods are mostly based either on neighborhood similarity. A link between two nodes is more likely to exist if there are many common neighbors. These are:
1. [Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)
2. [Overlap similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient)
3. [Adamic-Adar index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamic/Adar_index)

On the other hand, such a prediction can be learned from the node endpoints by looking at similarity metrics. The more similar the nodes are, the greater the likelihood of connectivity between them. [**Cosine similarity** and **Euclidean distance**](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/euclidean-distance-vs-cosine-similarity) are one example of such.

Then, there are the most advanced models so far and they are based on [**graph embeddings**](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-embeddings-the-summary-cc6075aba007), which serve as features for further classification tasks. Likewise, it is possible to drive **graph neural network (GNN)** methods for the same task.

> _Our little magician Memgraph MAGE has recently received one more spell - the Online Node2Vec algorithm. Since he is still too scared to use it, you, as a brave spirit, will step up and use it on a real challenge to show MAGE how itâ€™s done. This challenge includes building an Online Recommendation System using k-means clustering and the newborn spell - Online Node2Vec algorithm._


## Use cases

[![Drug Discovery](https://img.shields.io/badge/Drug_Discovery-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/use-cases/drug-discovery.md)

When discovering new drugs, methods of link prediction can help to determine the behavior of the new drug. Since there exists a database of already known side effects and reactions with other drugs, this knowledge can be used to predict newly constructed ones.

[![Social Networks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Social_Networks-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/use-cases/social-media.md)

One of the most obvious tasks of link prediction is predicting new friendships/followers on social networks. This concept is based on sharing the same entities on the graph, whether they are friends, interests, or things you follow.
