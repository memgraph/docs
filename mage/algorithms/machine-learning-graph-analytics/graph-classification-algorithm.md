## Description

Letâ€™s look at one useful tool that allows you to analyze a graph as a whole. That is the prediction of the graph. The structure and arrangement of nodes can reveal some hidden features in a graph.

So, for example, fraudsters who have a common pattern of behavior can be detected by searching that pattern in the neighborhood graph of the fraudster himself.

To make this possible, the main technique is to design a feature over the structure of the graph itself, and then apply a classification algorithm. This can be achieved in several ways:
1. Graphlet featuri - the number of a particular graphlet indicates a single element of the feature vector
2. Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel - color refinement, teaching colors to the neighborhood until convergence is achieved
3. Graph Deep Learning - designing a network that is able to extract a deeper feature depending on the structure of the graph
