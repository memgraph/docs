## Description

The k-means algorithm clusters given data by trying to separate samples in `n` groups of equal variance by minimizing the criterion known as 
within-the-cluster sum-of-squares. 
The algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified beforehand. In other words, the algorithm doesnâ€™t compute the optimal number of clusters to use, but leaves that task to the user. It scales well to large numbers of samples, and it has been applied in a wide range of fields such as recommendation engines, fraud detection and market research.
