### Implementation

![Node Classification](https://img.shields.io/badge/Not_implemented-EB3434?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)

Unfortunately, **Node Classification** is yet not implemented within the project [**MAGE**](https://github.com/memgraph/mage). Be sure to raise the issue on the GitHub repo and ping us to speed up the development. :point_up:
## Use cases

[![Finance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Finance-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/use-cases/finance.md)

Classifying nodes based on previously labeled data can help investigators to find out fraudsters in finance systems. Since fraudsters can often act very quickly with their tricks, applying a streaming-based node classification can help up building a real-time fraud detection system.

[![Computer Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer_Security-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/use-cases/computer-security.md)

Fraudsters usually behave differently than common users. This way a system can be observed and once an unusual behavior is spotted it can immediately be revealed. This can help build a bulletproof computer security system.
