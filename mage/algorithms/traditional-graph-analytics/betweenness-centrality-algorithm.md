## Description

Centrality analysis provides information about the nodeâ€™s importance for an information flow or connectivity of the network. [Betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality) is one of the most used centrality metrics. Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes in the graph. Thus, nodes with high **betweenness** may have considerable influence within a network under their control over information passing between others. The calculation of betweenness centrality is not standardized, and there are many ways to solve it.

It is defined as the **number of shortest paths** in the graph that passes through the node divided by the total number of shortest paths. The implemented algorithm is described in the paper "[A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/brandes01centrality.pdf)" by Ulrik Brandes of [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/).

> _In recent years, researchers have proved that essential proteins often have a correlation with disease genes. Therefore, the identification of essential > proteins is the foundation for disease diagnosis and treatment. Drug design methods heavily rely on detecting essential proteins to find drug targets._

## Use cases

[![Social networks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Social_networks-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/mage/applications/social-media-application)

The metric of **betweenness centrality** can be used on a **macro** and **micro** scale in social networks. On a macro scale, a high measure will indicate the position of power (due to the large flow of information). On the other hand, on a micro-scale, a high measure represents the strength of a relationship with a narrow circle of friends.

[![Bioinformatics](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bioinformatics-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/mage/applications/bioinformatics)

To get a better insight into how proteins interact with each other, [**protein-protein interaction network**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/network-analysis-of-protein-interaction-data-an-introduction/protein-protein-interaction-networks/) was created. Betweenness centrality (and other centrality measurements) can determine the strength of the fact that particular proteins are essential.


[![Transportation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Transportation-Application-8A477F?style=for-the-badge)](/mage/applications/transportation)

Maybe the most important usage of this algorithm is **transportation**. In an [complex and urban transportation network](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2019/9024745/), centrality measurement can reveal the main bottlenecks and congestions within the system. Such can help to organize the infrastructure of a big city, as well as the amount spent in optimizing such routes.
