**MAGE**, also known as **Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions**, is an
open-source repository that contains **graph algorithms** and **modules** in the
form of query modules written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can
find and contribute implementations of various algorithms in multiple
programming languages, all runnable inside Memgraph. This project aims to give
everyone the tools they need to tackle the most interesting and challenging
**graph analytics** problems.

## MAGE query modules

Memgraph introduces the concept of **query modules**, user-defined procedures
that extend the **Cypher query language**. These procedures are grouped into
modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. You can find more information on query
modules in the official [Memgraph
documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/database-functionalities/query-modules/built-in-query-modules).
