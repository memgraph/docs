**MAGE**, also known as **Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions**, is an
open-source repository that contains **graph algorithms** and **modules** in the form of query modules
written by the team behind Memgraph and its users. You can find and contribute implementations
of various algorithms in multiple programming languages, all runnable inside
Memgraph. This project aims to give everyone the tools they need to tackle the
most interesting and challenging **graph analytics** problems.

## MAGE query modules

Memgraph introduces the concept of **query modules**, user-defined procedures
that extend the **Cypher query language**. These procedures are grouped into
modules that can be loaded into Memgraph. You can find more information on query
modules in the official [Memgraph
documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/database-functionalities/query-modules/built-in-query-modules).
